# Annotations

```ebnf
  Annotation       ::=  ‘@’ SimpleType {ArgumentExprs}
  ConstrAnnotation ::=  ‘@’ SimpleType ArgumentExprs
```

## Definition

Annotations associate meta-information with definitions.
A simple annotation has the form `@´c´` or `@´c(a_1 , \ldots , a_n)´`.
Here, ´c´ is a constructor of a class ´C´, which must conform
to the class `scala.Annotation`.

Annotations may apply to definitions or declarations, types, or
expressions.  An annotation of a definition or declaration appears in
front of that definition.  An annotation of a type appears after
that type. An annotation of an expression ´e´ appears after the
expression ´e´, separated by a colon. More than one annotation clause
may apply to an entity. The order in which these annotations are given
does not matter.

Examples:

```scala
@deprecated("Use D", "1.0") class C { ... } // Class annotation
@transient @volatile var m: Int             // Variable annotation
String @local                               // Type annotation
(e: @unchecked) match { ... }               // Expression annotation
```

## Predefined Annotations

### Java Platform Annotations

The meaning of annotation clauses is implementation-dependent. On the
Java platform, the following annotations have a standard meaning.

  * `@transient` Marks a field to be non-persistent; this is
    equivalent to the `transient`
    modifier in Java.

  * `@volatile` Marks a field which can change its value
    outside the control of the program; this
    is equivalent to the `volatile`
    modifier in Java.

  * `@SerialVersionUID(<longlit>)` Attaches a serial version identifier (a
    `long` constant) to a class.
    This is equivalent to the following field
    definition in Java:

    ```java
    private final static SerialVersionUID = <longlit>
    ```

  * `@throws(<classlit>)` A Java compiler checks that a program contains handlers for checked exceptions
    by analyzing which checked exceptions can result from the execution of a method or
    constructor. For each checked exception which is a possible result, the
    `throws`
    clause for the method or constructor must mention the class of that exception
    or one of the superclasses of the class of that exception.

### Java Beans Annotations

  * `@scala.beans.BeanProperty` When prefixed to a definition of some variable `X`, this
    annotation causes getter and setter methods `getX`, `setX`
    in the Java bean style to be added in the class containing the
    variable. The first letter of the variable appears capitalized after
    the `get` or `set`. When the annotation is added to the
    definition of an immutable value definition `X`, only a getter is
    generated. The construction of these methods is part of
    code-generation; therefore, these methods become visible only once a
    classfile for the containing class is generated.

  * `@scala.beans.BooleanBeanProperty` This annotation is equivalent to `scala.reflect.BeanProperty`, but
    the generated getter method is named `isX` instead of `getX`.

### Deprecation Annotations

  * `@deprecated(message: <stringlit>, since: <stringlit>)`<br/>
    Marks a definition as deprecated. Accesses to the
    defined entity will then cause a deprecated warning mentioning the
    _message_ `<stringlit>` to be issued from the compiler.
    The argument _since_ documents since when the definition should be considered deprecated.<br/>
    Deprecated warnings are suppressed in code that belongs itself to a definition
    that is labeled deprecated.

  * `@deprecatedName(name: <stringlit>, since: <stringlit>)`<br/>
    Marks a formal parameter name as deprecated. Invocations of this entity
    using named parameter syntax referring to the deprecated parameter name cause a deprecation warning.

### Scala Compiler Annotations

  * `@unchecked` When applied to the selector of a `match` expression,
    this attribute suppresses any warnings about non-exhaustive pattern
    matches that would otherwise be emitted. For instance, no warnings
    would be produced for the method definition below.

    ```scala
    def f(x: Option[Int]) = (x: @unchecked) match {
      case Some(y) => y
    }
    ```

    Without the `@unchecked` annotation, a Scala compiler could
    infer that the pattern match is non-exhaustive, and could produce a
    warning because `Option` is a `sealed` class.

  * `@uncheckedStable` When applied a value declaration or definition, it allows the defined
    value to appear in a path, even if its type is [volatile](03-types.html#volatile-types).
    For instance, the following member definitions are legal:

    ```scala
    type A { type T }
    type B
    @uncheckedStable val x: A with B // volatile type
    val y: x.T                       // OK since `x' is still a path
    ```

    Without the `@uncheckedStable` annotation, the designator `x`
    would not be a path since its type `A with B` is volatile. Hence,
    the reference `x.T` would be malformed.

    When applied to value declarations or definitions that have non-volatile
    types, the annotation has no effect.

  * `@specialized` When applied to the definition of a type parameter, this annotation causes
    the compiler
    to generate specialized definitions for primitive types. An optional list of
    primitive
    types may be given, in which case specialization takes into account only
    those types.
    For instance, the following code would generate specialized traits for
    `Unit`, `Int` and `Double`

    ```scala
    trait Function0[@specialized(Unit, Int, Double) T] {
      def apply: T
    }
    ```

    Whenever the static type of an expression matches a specialized variant of
    a definition, the compiler will instead use the specialized version.
    See the [specialization sid](https://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/scala-specialization.html) for more details of the implementation.
    

## User-defined Annotations

Other annotations may be interpreted by platform- or application-dependent
tools. The class `scala.annotation.Annotation` is the base class for
user-defined annotations. It has two sub-traits:
- `scala.annotation.StaticAnnotation`: Instances of a subclass of this trait
  will be stored in the generated class files, and therefore accessible to
  runtime reflection and later compilation runs.
- `scala.annotation.ConstantAnnotation`: Instances of a subclass of this trait
  may only have arguments which are
  [constant expressions](06-expressions.html#constant-expressions), and are
  also stored in the generated class files.
- If an annotation class inherits from neither `scala.ConstantAnnotation` nor
  `scala.StaticAnnotation`, its instances are visible only locally during the
  compilation run that analyzes them.

## Host-platform Annotations

The host platform may define its own annotation format. These annotations do not
extend any of the classes in the `scala.annotation` package, but can generally
be used in the same way as Scala annotations. The host platform may impose
additional restrictions on the expressions which are valid as annotation
arguments.
