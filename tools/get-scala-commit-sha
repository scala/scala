# Usage: get-scala-commit-sha [dir]
# Figures out current commit sha of a git clone.
# If no dir is given, current working dir is used.
#
# Example build version string:
#   6f1c486d0ba
#

[[ $# -eq 0 ]] || cd "$1"

# printf %016s is not portable for 0-padding, has to be a digit.
# so we're stuck disassembling it.
