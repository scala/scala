# Scala Project & Developer Guidelines

These guidelines are meant to be a living document that should be changed and adapted as needed. We encourage changes that make it easier to achieve our goals in an efficient way. 

## General Workflow

This is the process for committing code to the Scala project. There are of course exceptions to these rules, for example minor changes to comments and documentation, fixing a broken build etc.

1. Make sure you have signed the [Scala CLA](http://www.scala-lang.org/sites/default/files/contributor_agreement.pdf), if not, sign it.
2. Before starting to work on a feature or a fix, it's good practice to ensure that:
    1. There is a ticket for your work in the project's issue tracker. If not, create it first (perhaps given a thumbs up from the scala-internals mailing list first).
    2. The ticket has been discussed and prioritized by the team.
3. You should always perform your work in its own Git branch. The branch should be given a descriptive name that explains its intent. Some teams also like adding the ticket number and/or the [GitHub](http://github.com) user ID to the branch name, these details is up to each of the individual teams. (See below for more details on branch naming.)
4. When the feature or fix is completed you should open a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) on GitHub.
5. The Pull Request should be reviewed by other maintainers (as many as feasible/practical). Note that a reviewer can also be an outside contributor-- members of Typesafe and independent contributors are encouraged to participate in the review process. It is not a closed process.
6. After the review, you should resolve issues brought up by the reviewers as needed (pushing a new commit to address reviewers' comments), iterating until the reviewers give their thumbs up, the "LGTM" (acronym for "Looks Good To Me").
7. Once the code has passed review the Pull Request can be merged into the distribution.

## Pull Request Requirements

Fist, please have a look at and follow the [Pull Request Policy](https://github.com/scala/scala/wiki/Pull-Request-Policy) for guidelines on submitting a pull request to the Scala project.

In order for a Pull Request to be considered, it has to meet these requirements:

1. Live up to the current code standard:
   - Not violate [DRY](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/Don%27t_Repeat_Yourself).
   - [Boy Scout Rule](http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Boy_Scout_Rule) should be applied.
2. Tests are of paramount importance. 
3. The code must be well documented in the project's standard documentation format (see the ‘Documentation’ section below).

If *all* of these requirements are not met then the code should **not** be merged into the distribution, and need not even be reviewed.

## Documentation

All contributed code should come accompanied with documentation. Pull requests containing undocumented code will not be accepted. Both user-facing Scaladoc comments, as well as committer-facing internal documentation (i.e. important design decisions that other maintainers should know about should be placed inline with line comments `//`) should be accompanying all contributed code where possible.


## Work In Progress

It is ok to work on a public feature branch in the GitHub repository. Something that can sometimes be useful for early feedback etc. If so, then it is preferable to name the branch accordingly. This can be done by either prefixing the name with ``wip-`` as in ‘Work In Progress’, or use hierarchical names like ``wip/..``, ``feature/..`` or ``topic/..``. Either way is fine as long as it is clear that it is work in progress and not ready for merge. This work can temporarily have a lower standard. However, to be merged into master it will have to go through the regular process outlined above, with Pull Request, review etc.. 

Also, to facilitate both well-formed commits and working together, the ``wip`` and ``feature``/``topic`` identifiers also have special meaning.   Any branch labelled with ``wip`` is considered “git-unstable” and may be rebased and have its history rewritten.   Any branch with ``feature``/``topic`` in the name is considered “stable” enough for others to depend on when a group is working on a feature.

## Creating Commits And Writing Commit Messages

Follow these guidelines when creating public commits and writing commit messages.

1. If your work spans multiple local commits (for example; if you do safe point commits while working in a feature branch or work in a branch for long time doing merges/rebases etc.) then please do not commit it all but rewrite the history by squashing the commits into a single big commit which you write a good commit message for (like discussed in the following sections). For more info read this article: [Git Workflow](http://sandofsky.com/blog/git-workflow.html). Every commit should be able to be used in isolation-- that is, each commit must build and pass all tests.
2. The first line should be a descriptive sentence what the commit is doing. It should be possible to fully understand what the commit does by just reading this single line. It is **not ok** to only list the ticket number, type "minor fix" or similar. Include reference to ticket number, prefixed with "SI-", at the beginning of the first line followed by the title of the ticket, assuming it aptly and concisely summarizes the commit in a single line. If the commit is a small fix, then you are done. If not, go to 3.
3. Following the single line description should be a blank line followed by an enumerated list with the details of the commit.
4. Add keywords for your commit (depending on the degree of automation we reach, the list may change over time):
    * ``Review by @gituser`` - if you want to notify someone on the team. The others can, and are encouraged to participate.
    * ``Fix/Fixing/Fixes/Close/Closing/Refs #ticket`` - if you want to mark the ticket as fixed in the issue tracker (Assembla understands this).
    * ``backport to _branch name_`` - if the fix needs to be cherry-picked to another branch (like 2.9.x, 2.10.x, etc)

Example:

    SI-4032 Implicit conversion visibility affected by presence of "this"

      * Details 1
      * Details 2
      * Details 3

## The Scala Improvement Process
A new language feature requires as SIP (Scala Improvement Process). Note that the standard library is considered part of the library.
For more details, here's (how to submit a SIP)[http://docs.scala-lang.org/sips/sip-submission.html].
