* Introduction

This directory contains an additional wordlist file (.txt) for
Scala programs.

More information about UltraEdit (Windows only) is available from:

   http://www.ultraedit.com/

* Installation

In the dialog window "UltraEdit Configuration" (menu "Advanced" ->
entry "Configuration..") click on the tab "Syntax Highlighting" and
then on the "Open" button to edit the file "wordlist.txt".

Copy the contents of file "scala.txt" to the end of the file
"wordlist.txt" und change the text label '/L20"Scala"' to the next
available value (e.g. '/L10"Scala").

From that point on, loading a file whose name ends in ".scala" automatically
turns Scala mode on.
