# NOTE: this file determines the content of the scala-distribution
# via scala-dist-pom.xml and scala-library-all-pom.xml
# when adding new properties that influence a release,
# also add them to the update.versions mechanism in build.xml,
# which is used by the release script scripts/jobs/integrate/bootstrap

# The scala version used for boostrapping. This has no impact on the final classfiles:
# there are two stages (locker and quick), so compiler and library are always built
# with themselves. Stability is ensured by building a third stage (strap).
starr.version=2.11.6

# These are the versions of the modules that go with this release.
# These properties are used during PR validation and in dbuild builds.

# The scala.binary.version determines how modules are resolved. For example, it
# determines which partest artifact is being used for running the tests.
# It has to be set in the following way:
#  - After 2.x.0 is released, the binary version is 2.x.
#  - During milestones and RCs, modules are cross-built against the full version.
#    So the value is the full version (e.g. 2.12.0-M1).
scala.binary.version=2.11
# e.g. 2.11.0-RC1, 2.11.0, 2.11.1-RC1, 2.11.1
# this defines the dependency on scala-continuations-plugin in scala-dist's pom
