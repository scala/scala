# These are the versions of the modules that go with this release.
# These properties are used during PR validation and in dbuild builds.

# The scala.binary.version determines how modules are resolved. For example, it
# determines which partest artifact is being used for running the tests.
# It has to be set in the following way:
#  - After 2.x.0 is released, the binary version is 2.x.
#  - During milestones and RCs, modules are cross-built against the full version.
#    So the value is the full version (e.g. 2.12.0-M2).
