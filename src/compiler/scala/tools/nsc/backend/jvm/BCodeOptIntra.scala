   * One of the intra-method optimizations (dead-code elimination)

   *
   * TODO SI-6759 Seek clarification about necessary and sufficient conditions to be listed in InnerClasses JVM attribute (GenASM).
   * The JVM spec states in Sec. 4.7.6 that
   *   for each CONSTANT_Class_info (constant-pool entry) which represents a class or interface that is not a member of a package
   * an entry should be made in the class' InnerClasses JVM attribute.
   * According to the above, the mere fact an inner class is mentioned in, for example, an annotation
   * wouldn't be reason enough for adding it to the InnerClasses JVM attribute.
   * However that's what GenASM does. Instead, this method scans only those internal names that will make it to a CONSTANT_Class_info.
   *
   * `refreshInnerClasses()` requires that `exemplars` already tracks
   * each BType of hasObjectSort variety that is mentioned in the ClassNode.
