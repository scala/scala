     *  Emitting try-catch is easy, emitting try-catch-finally not quite so.
     *  A finally-block (which always has type Unit, thus leaving the operand stack unchanged)
     *  affects control-transfer from protected regions, as follows:
     *
     *    (a) `return` statement:
     *
     *        First, the value to return (if any) is evaluated.
     *        Afterwards, all enclosing finally-blocks are run, from innermost to outermost.
     *        Only then is the return value (if any) returned.
     *
     *        Some terminology:
     *          (a.1) Executing a return statement that is protected
     *                by one or more finally-blocks is called "early return"
     *          (a.2) the chain of code sections (a code section for each enclosing finally-block)
     *                to run upon early returns is called "cleanup chain"
     *
     *        As an additional spin, consider a return statement in a finally-block.
     *        In this case, the value to return depends on how control arrived at that statement:
     *        in case it arrived via a previous return, the previous return enjoys priority:
     *        the value to return is given by that statement.
     *
     *    (b) A finally-block protects both the try-clause and the catch-clauses.
     *
     *           Sidenote:
     *             A try-clause may contain an empty block. On CLR, a finally-block has special semantics
     *             regarding Abort interruptions; but on the JVM it's safe to elide an exception-handler
     *             that protects an "empty" range ("empty" as in "containing NOPs only",
     *             see `asm.optimiz.DanglingExcHandlers` and SI-6720).
     *
     *        This means a finally-block indicates instructions that can be reached:
     *          (b.1) Upon normal (non-early-returning) completion of the try-clause or a catch-clause
     *                In this case, the next-program-point is that following the try-catch-finally expression.
     *          (b.2) Upon early-return initiated in the try-clause or a catch-clause
     *                In this case, the next-program-point is the enclosing cleanup section (if any), otherwise return.
     *          (b.3) Upon abrupt termination (due to unhandled exception) of the try-clause or a catch-clause
     *                In this case, the unhandled exception must be re-thrown after running the finally-block.
     *
     *    (c) finally-blocks are implicit to `synchronized` (a finally-block is added to just release the lock)
     *        that's why `genSynchronized()` too emits cleanup-sections.
     *
     *  A number of code patterns can be emitted to realize the intended semantics.
     *
     *  A popular alternative (GenICode, javac) consists in duplicating the cleanup-chain at each early-return position.
     *  The principle at work being that once control is transferred to a cleanup-section,
     *  control will always stay within the cleanup-chain.
     *  That is, barring an exception being thrown in a cleanup-section, in which case the enclosing try-block
     *  (reached via abrupt termination) takes over.
     *
     *  The observations above hint at another code layout, less verbose, for the cleanup-chain.
     *
     *  The code layout that GenBCode emits takes into account that once a cleanup section has been reached,
     *  jumping to the next cleanup-section (and so on, until the outermost one) realizes the correct semantics.
     *
     *  There is still code duplication in that two cleanup-chains are needed (but this is unavoidable, anyway):
     *  one for normal control flow and another chain consisting of exception handlers.
     *  The in-line comments below refer to them as
     *    - "early-return-cleanups" and
     *    - "exception-handler-version-of-finally-block" respectively.
