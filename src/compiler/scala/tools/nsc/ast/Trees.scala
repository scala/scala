  // Finally, no one uses resetAllAttrs anymore, so I'm removing it from the compiler.
  // Even though it's with great pleasure I'm doing that, I'll leave its body here to warn future generations about what happened in the past.
  //
  // So what actually happened in the past is that we used to have two flavors of resetAttrs: resetAllAttrs and resetLocalAttrs.
  // resetAllAttrs destroyed all symbols and types in the tree in order to reset its state to something suitable for retypechecking
  // and/or embedding into bigger trees / different lexical scopes. (Btw here's some background on why people would want to use
  // reset attrs in the first place: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-internals/TtCTPlj_qcQ).
  //
  // However resetAllAttrs was more of a poison than of a treatment, because along with locally defined symbols that are the cause
  // for almost every or maybe even every case of tree corruption, it erased external bindings that sometimes could not be restored.
  // This is how we came up with resetLocalAttrs that left external bindings alone, and that was a big step forward.
  // Then slowly but steadily we've evicted all usages of resetAllAttrs from our codebase in favor of resetLocalAttrs
  // and have been living happily ever after.
  //
  // def resetAllAttrs(x: Tree, leaveAlone: Tree => Boolean = null): Tree = new ResetAttrs(localOnly = false, leaveAlone).transform(x)

  // upd. Unfortunately this didn't work out quite as we expected. The last two users of resetAllAttrs:
  // reification and typedLabelDef broke in very weird ways when we replaced resetAllAttrs with resetLocalAttrs
  // (see SI-8316 change from resetAllAttrs to resetLocalAttrs in reifiers broke Slick and
  // SI-8318 NPE in mixin in scala-continuations for more information).
  // Given that we're supposed to release 2.11.0-RC1 in less than a week, I'm temporarily reinstating resetAllAttrs
  // until we have time to better understand what's going on. In order to dissuade people from using it,
  // it now comes with a new, ridiculous name.
