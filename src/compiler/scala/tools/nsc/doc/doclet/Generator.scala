/** Custom Scaladoc generators must implement the `Generator` class. A custom generator can be selected in Scaladoc
  * using the `-doc-generator` command line option.
  * The `Generator` class does not provide data about the documented code. A number of data provider traits can be used
  * to configure what data is actually available to the generator:
  *  - A `Universer` provides a `Universe` data structure representing the interfaces and comments of the documented
  *    program.
  *  - An `Indexer` provides precalculated indexing information about a universe.
  * To implement this class only requires defining method `generateImpl`. */
