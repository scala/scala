/** An extractor returns: F1, F2, ..., Fi, opt[Seq[E] or E*]
 *        A case matches: P1, P2, ..., Pj, opt[Seq[E]]
 *          Put together: P1/F1, P2/F2, ... Pi/Fi, Pi+1/E, Pi+2/E, ... Pj/E, opt[Seq[E]]
 *
 *  Here Pm/Fi is the last pattern to match the fixed arity section.
 *
 *    productArity: the value of i, i.e. the number of non-sequence types in the extractor
 *    nonStarArity: the value of j, i.e. the number of non-star patterns in the case definition
 *    elementArity: j - i, i.e. the number of non-star patterns which must match sequence elements
 *       starArity: 1 or 0 based on whether there is a star (sequence-absorbing) pattern
 *      totalArity: nonStarArity + starArity, i.e. the number of patterns in the case definition
 *
 *  Note that productArity is a function only of the extractor, and
 *  nonStar/star/totalArity are all functions of the patterns. The key
 *  value for aligning and typing the patterns is elementArity, as it
 *  is derived from both sets of information.

   *  type of the unapply method.
