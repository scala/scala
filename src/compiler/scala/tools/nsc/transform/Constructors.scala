   * Summary
   * -------
   *
   * The following gets elided unless they're actually needed:
   *   (a) parameter-accessor fields for non-val, non-var, constructor-param-symbols, as well as
   *   (b) outer accessors of a final class which don't override anything.
   *
   *
   * Gory details
   * ------------
   *
   * The constructors phase elides
   *
   *  (a) parameter-accessor fields for non-val, non-var, constructor-param-symbols
   *      provided they're only accessed within the primary constructor;
   *
   * as well as
   *
   *  (b) outer accessors directly owned by the class of interest,
   *      provided that class is final, they don't override anything, and moreover they aren't accessed anywhere.
   *      An outer accessor is backed by a param-accessor field.
   *      If an outer-accessor can be elided then its supporting field can be elided as well.
   *
   * Once the potential candidates for elision are known (as described above) it remains to visit
   * those program locations where they might be accessed, and only those.
   *
   * What trees can be visited at this point?
   * To recap, by the time the constructors phase runs, local definitions have been hoisted out of their original owner.
   * Moreover, by the time elision is about to happen, the `intoConstructors` rewriting
   * of template-level statements has taken place (the resulting trees can be found in `constrStatBuf`).
   *
   * That means:
   *
   *   - nested classes are to be found in `defBuf`
   *
   *   - value and method definitions are also in `defBuf` and none of them contains local methods or classes.
   *
   *   - auxiliary constructors are to be found in `auxConstructorBuf`
   *
   * Coming back to the question which trees may contain accesses:
   *
   *   (c) regarding parameter-accessor fields, all candidates in (a) are necessarily private-local,
   *       and thus may only be accessed from value or method definitions owned by the current class
   *       (ie there's no point drilling down into nested classes).
   *
   *   (d) regarding candidates in (b), they are accesible from all places listed in (c) and in addition
   *       from nested classes (nested at any number of levels).
   *
   * In all cases, we're done with traversing as soon as all candidates have been ruled out.
   *
   * Finally, the whole affair of eliding is avoided for DelayedInit subclasses,
   * given that for them usually nothing gets elided anyway.
   * That's a consequence from re-locating the post-super-calls statements from their original location
   * (the primary constructor) into a dedicated synthetic method that an anon-closure may invoke, as required by DelayedInit.
   *

  /*
   *  TemplateTransformer rewrites DelayedInit subclasses.
   *  The list of statements that will end up in the primary constructor can be split into:
   *
   *    (a) up to and including the super-constructor call.
   *        These statements can occur only in the (bytecode-level) primary constructor.
   *
   *    (b) remaining statements
   *
   *  The purpose of DelayedInit is leaving (b) out of the primary constructor and have their execution "delayed".
   *
   *  The rewriting to achieve "delayed initialization" involves:
   *    (c) an additional, synthetic, public method encapsulating (b)
   *    (d) an additional, synthetic closure whose argless apply() just invokes (c)
   *    (e) after executing the statements in (a),
   *        the primary constructor instantiates (d) and passes it as argument
   *        to a `delayedInit()` invocation on the current instance.
   *        In turn, `delayedInit()` is a method defined as abstract in the `DelayedInit` trait
   *        so that it can be overridden (for an example see `scala.App`)
   *
   *  The following helper methods prepare Trees as part of this rewriting:
   *
   *    (f) `delayedEndpointDef()` prepares (c).
   *        A transformer, `constrStatTransformer`, is used to re-locate statements (b) from template-level
   *        to become statements in method (c). The main task here is re-formulating accesses to params
   *        of the primary constructors (to recap, (c) has zero-params) in terms of param-accessor fields.
   *        In a Delayed-Init subclass, each class-constructor gets a param-accessor field because `mustbeKept()` forces it.
   *
   *    (g) `delayedInitClosure()` prepares (d)
   *
   *    (h) `delayedInitCall()`    prepares the `delayedInit()` invocation referred to in (e)
   *
   *  Both (c) and (d) are added to the Template returned by `transformClassTemplate()`
   *
   *  A note of historic interest: Previously the rewriting for DelayedInit would include in the closure body
   *  all of the delayed initialization sequence, which in turn required:
   *    - reformulating "accesses-on-this" into "accesses-on-outer", and
   *    - adding public getters and setters.
   *
   *  @param stats the statements in (b) above
   *
   *  @return the DefDef for (c) above
   *

  /*
   * Motivation
   * ----------
   *
   * This transformation
   *   - shortens navigation-paths over outer-instances to minimize heap retention at runtime,
   *   - by caching not the direct outer-instance but the nearest outer-instance that's actually needed.
   *
   * In particular, this transformation benefits actors, which usually hand out closures that outlive the actor.
   *
   *
   * Before and after this transformation
   * ------------------------------------
   *
   * For an inner class C fulfilling the preconditions detailed in `preconds()` (for example, an anonymous-closure),
   * it's possible to visit all usages of outer-accessors to find
   * the innermost outer-instance of C that's actually needed (there's only one, details in `jumpOverRedundantOuters()).
   * That's the outer-instance to be cached in place of the direct outer-instance.
   *
   * Before this transformation:
   *   - C holds its direct-outer in C's outer-field
   *
   * After this transformation:
   *   - C holds the nearest outer-instance that's actually needed in a field named "cachedOuter$"
   *   - accesses over outer-chains are simplified to take as starting point the cached outer-instance
   *   - the original outer-field isn't removed by this transformation but by `OmittablesHelper`
   *
   *
   * Interplay with other transforms, Performance impact
   * ---------------------------------------------------
   *
   * This transformation is self-contained (in the constructors phase) ie none of the other compilation phases
   * need perform additional work in support of `JumpOverOuters`.
   *
   * Irrespective of object size and lifetime, this transformation never degrades performance nor increases memory footprint,
   * thus it's always applied when conditions are fulfilled.
   *
   *
   * Overview of the implementation
   * ------------------------------
   *
   * Once triaging of template-members has been completed,
   * and before unused outer-fields are elided, it's `JumpOverOuters` time.
   *
   * The implementation is easier to grok from its entry point: `jumpOverRedundantOuters()`
   * Its description summarizes the utility methods at play (also documented)
   * and the role played by the `LinksCollector` utility class.
   *
