/**
 * An InfoTransform contains a compiler phase that transforms trees and symbol infos -- making sure they stay consistent.
 * The symbol info is transformed assuming it is consistent right before this phase.
 * The info transformation is triggered by Symbol::rawInfo, which caches the results in the symbol's type history.
 * This way sym.info (during an enteringPhase(p)) can look up what the symbol's info should look like at the beginning of phase p.
 * (If the transformed info had not been stored yet, rawInfo will compute the info by composing the info-transformers
 *  of the most recent phase before p, up to the transformer of the phase right before p.)
 *
 * Concretely, enteringPhase(p) { sym.info } yields the info *before* phase p has transformed it. Imagine you're a phase and it all makes sense.
