  /** Encapsulates reifier state
   *
   *  When untangling reifier symbol tables from the reifier itself,
   *  I discovered that encoding of a symbol table (e.g. producing corresponding reificode)
   *  might cause subsequent reification (e.g. when filling in signatures and annotations for syms).
   *
   *  This is a mess in the face of nested reifications, splices and inlining of thereof,
   *  so I made `SymbolTable` immutable, which brought a significant amount of sanity.
   *
   *  However that wasn't enough. Sure, symbol table became immutable, but the reifier still needed
   *  to mutate its `symtab` field during reification. This caused nasty desyncs between the table being encoded
   *  and the table of the underlying reifier, so I decided to encapsulate the entire state here,
   *  so that encoding can backup the state before it starts and restore it after it completes.
