  /**
   *  Makes sense of cross-stage bindings.
   *
   *  ================
   *
   *  Analysis of cross-stage bindings becomes convenient if we introduce the notion of metalevels.
   *  Metalevel of a tree is a number that gets incremented every time you reify something and gets decremented when you splice something.
   *  Metalevel of a symbol is equal to the metalevel of its definition.
   *
   *  Example 1. Consider the following snippet:
   *
   *    reify {
   *      val x = 2             // metalevel of symbol x is 1, because it's declared inside reify
   *      val y = reify{x}      // metalevel of symbol y is 1, because it's declared inside reify
   *                            // metalevel of Ident(x) is 2, because it's inside two reifies
   *      y.splice              // metalevel of Ident(y) is 0, because it's inside a designator of a splice
   *    }
   *
   *  Cross-stage bindings are introduced when symbol.metalevel != curr_metalevel.
   *  Both bindings introduced in Example 1 are cross-stage.
   *
   *  Depending on what side of the inequality is greater, the following situations might occur:
   *
   *  1) symbol.metalevel < curr_metalevel. In this case reifier will generate a free variable
   *  that captures both the name of the symbol (to be compiled successfully) and its value (to be run successfully).
   *  For example, x in Example 1 will be reified as follows: Ident(newFreeVar("x", IntClass.tpe, x))
   *
   *  2) symbol.metalevel > curr_metalevel. This leads to a metalevel breach that violates intuitive perception of splicing.
   *  As defined in macro spec, splicing takes a tree and inserts it into another tree - as simple as that.
   *  However, how exactly do we do that in the case of y.splice? In this very scenario we can use dataflow analysis and inline it,
   *  but what if y were a var, and what if it were calculated randomly at runtime?
   *
   *  This question has a genuinely simple answer. Sure, we cannot resolve such splices statically (i.e. during macro expansion of ``reify''),
   *  but now we have runtime toolboxes, so noone stops us from picking up that reified tree and evaluating it at runtime
   *  (in fact, this is something that ``Expr.splice'' does transparently).
   *
   *  This is akin to early vs late binding dilemma.
   *  The prior is faster, plus, the latter (implemented with reflection) might not work because of visibility issues or might be not available on all platforms.
   *  But the latter still has its uses, so I'm allowing metalevel breaches, but introducing the -Xlog-runtime-evals to log them.
   *
   *  upd. We no longer do that. In case of a runaway ``splice'' inside a `reify`, one will get a static error.
   *  Why? Unfortunately, the cute idea of transparently converting between static and dynamic splices has failed.
   *  1) Runtime eval that services dynamic splices requires scala-compiler.jar, which might not be on library classpath
   *  2) Runtime eval incurs a severe performance penalty, so it'd better to be explicit about it
   *
   *  ================
   *
   *  As we can see, the only problem is the fact that lhs'es of `splice` can be code blocks that can capture variables from the outside.
   *  Code inside the lhs of an `splice` is not reified, while the code from the enclosing reify is.
   *
   *  Hence some bindings become cross-stage, which is not bad per se (in fact, some cross-stage bindings have sane semantics, as in the example above).
   *  However this affects freevars, since they are delicate inter-dimensional beings that refer to both current and next planes of existence.
   *  When splicing tears the fabric of the reality apart, some freevars have to go single-dimensional to retain their sanity.
   *
   *  Example 2. Consider the following snippet:
   *
   *    reify {
   *      val x = 2
   *      reify{x}.splice
   *    }
   *
   *  Since the result of the inner reify is wrapped in a splice, it won't be reified
   *  together with the other parts of the outer reify, but will be inserted into that result verbatim.
   *
   *  The inner reify produces an Expr[Int] that wraps Ident(freeVar("x", IntClass.tpe, x)).
   *  However the freevar the reification points to will vanish when the compiler processes the outer reify.
   *  That's why we need to replace that freevar with a regular symbol that will point to reified x.
   *
   *  Example 3. Consider the following fragment:
   *
   *    reify {
   *      val x = 2
   *      val y = reify{x}
   *      y.splice
   *    }
   *
   *  In this case the inner reify doesn't appear next to splice, so it will be reified together with x.
   *  This means that no special processing is needed here.
   *
   *  Example 4. Consider the following fragment:
   *
   *    reify {
   *      val x = 2
   *      {
   *        val y = 2
   *        val z = reify{reify{x + y}}
   *        z.splice
   *      }.splice
   *    }
   *
   *  The reasoning from Example 2 still holds here - we do need to inline the freevar that refers to x.
   *  However, we must not touch anything inside the splice'd block, because it's not getting reified.
