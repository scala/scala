/** An abstraction for considering symbol pairs.
 *  One of the greatest sources of compiler bugs is that symbols can
 *  trivially lose their prefixes and turn into some completely different
 *  type with the smallest of errors. It is the exception not the rule
 *  that type comparisons are done correctly.
 *
 *  This offers a small step toward coherence with two abstractions
 *  which come up over and over again:
 *
 *    RelativeTo: operations relative to a prefix
 *    SymbolPair: two symbols being related somehow, plus the class
 *       in which the relation is being performed
 *
 *  This is only a start, but it is a start.
