 *
 * This trait defines the node types used in Scala abstract syntax trees (AST) and operations on them.
 *
 * Trees are the basis for Scala's abstract syntax that is used to represent programs. They are also called
 * abstract syntax trees and commonly abbreviated as ASTs.
 *
 * In Scala reflection, APIs that produce or use `Tree`s are:
 *
 *   - '''Annotations''' which use trees to represent their arguments, exposed in [[scala.reflect.api.Annotations#scalaArgs Annotation.scalaArgs]].
 *   - '''[[scala.reflect.api.Universe#reify reify]]''', a special method on [[scala.reflect.api.Universe]] that takes an expression and returns an AST which represents the expression.
 *   - '''Macros and runtime compilation with toolboxes''' which both use trees as their program representation medium.
 *
 *  Trees are immutable, except for three fields
 *  [[Trees#TreeApi.pos pos]], [[Trees#TreeApi.symbol symbol]], and [[Trees#TreeApi.tpe tpe]], which are assigned when a tree is typechecked
 *  to attribute it with the information gathered by the typechecker.
 *
 *  === Examples ===
 *
 *  The following creates an AST representing a literal 5 in Scala source code:
 *  {{{
 *    Literal(Constant(5))
 *  }}}
 *
 *  The following creates an AST representing `print("Hello World")`:
 *  {{{
 *    Apply(Select(Select(This(newTypeName("scala")), newTermName("Predef")), newTermName("print")), List(Literal(Constant("Hello World"))))
 *  }}}
 *
 *  The following creates an AST from a literal 5, and then uses `showRaw` to print it in a readable format.
 *  {{{
 *    import scala.reflect.runtime.universe.{ reify, showRaw }
 *    print( showRaw( reify{5}.tree ) )` // prints Literal(Constant(5))
 *  }}}
 *
 *  For more information about `Tree`s, see the [[http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/reflection/symbols-trees-types.html Reflection Guide: Symbols, Trees, Types]].
