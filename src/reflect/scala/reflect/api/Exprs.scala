/**
 * <span class="badge badge-red" style="float: right;">EXPERIMENTAL</span>
 *
 * A trait that defines strongly-typed tree wrappers and operations on them for use in Scala Reflection.
 *
 *  `Expr` wraps an abstract syntax tree ([[scala.reflect.api.Trees#Tree]]) and tags it with its type ([[scala.reflect.api.Types#Type]]).
 *
 *  Usually `Expr`s are created via [[scala.reflect.api.Universe#reify]], in which case a compiler
 *  produces a [[scala.reflect.api.TreeCreator]] for the provided expression and also
 *  creates a complementary [[scala.reflect.api.TypeTags#WeakTypeTag]] that corresponds to the type of that expression.
 *
 * `Expr`s can also be created manually via the `Expr` companion object, but then the burden of providing a `TreeCreator` lies on the programmer.
 *  Compile-time reflection via macros, as described in [[scala.reflect.macros.Aliases]], provides an easier way to instantiate exprs manually.
 *  Manual creation, however, is very rarely needed when working with runtime reflection.
 *
 *  `Expr` can be migrated from one mirror to another by using the `in` method. Migration means that all symbolic references
 *  to classes/objects/packages in the expression are re-resolved within the new mirror
 *  (typically using that mirror's classloader). The default universe of an `Expr` is typically
 *  [[scala.reflect.runtime#universe]], the default mirror is typically [[scala.reflect.runtime#currentMirror]].

     * If used alone `splice` throws an exception when called at runtime.
     *
     * If you want to use an Expr in reification of some Scala code, you need to splice it in.

     * {{{
     *   reify{ expr.splice.foo }
     * }}}
     * uses splice to turn an expr of type Expr[T] into a value of type T in the context of `reify`.

     * It is equivalent to
     * {{{
     *   Select( expr.tree, TermName("foo") )

     * The following example code however does not compile
     * {{{
