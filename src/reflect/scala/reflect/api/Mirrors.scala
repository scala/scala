/**
 * <span class="badge badge-red" style="float: right;">EXPERIMENTAL</span>
 *
 * This trait provides support for Mirrors in the Scala Reflection API.
 *
 * `Mirror`s are a central part of Scala Reflection. All information provided by
 * reflection is made accessible through `Mirror`s. Depending on the type of information
 * to be obtained, or the reflective action to be taken, different flavors of mirrors
 * must be used. "Classloader" mirrors can be used to obtain representations of types
 * and members. From a classloader `Mirror`, it's possible to obtain more specialized
 * "invoker" `Mirror`s (the most commonly-used mirrors), which implement reflective
 * invocations, such as method/constructor calls and field accesses.
 *
 * The two flavors of mirrors:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>'''“Classloader” mirrors'''. These mirrors translate names to symbols
 * (via methods `staticClass`/`staticModule`/`staticPackage`).</li>
 * <li>'''"Invoker” mirrors'''. These mirrors implement reflective invocations
 * (via methods `MethodMirror.apply`, `FieldMirror.get`, etc). These "invoker"
 * mirrors are the types of mirrors that are most commonly used.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * === Compile-time Mirrors ===
 * Compile-time `Mirror`s make use of only classloader `Mirror`s to load `Symbol`s
 * by name.
 *
 * The entry point to classloader `Mirror`s is via [[scala.reflect.macros.Context#mirror]].
 * Typical methods which use classloader `Mirror`s include [[scala.reflect.api.Mirror#staticClass]],
 * [[scala.reflect.api.Mirror#staticModule]], and [[scala.reflect.api.Mirror#staticPackage]]. For
 * example:
 * {{{
 *  import scala.reflect.macros.Context
 *
 *  case class Location(filename: String, line: Int, column: Int)
 *
 *  object Macros {
 *    def currentLocation: Location = macro impl
 *
 *    def impl(c: Context): c.Expr[Location] = {
 *      import c.universe._
 *      val pos = c.macroApplication.pos
 *      val clsLocation = c.mirror.staticModule("Location") // get symbol of "Location" object
 *      c.Expr(Apply(Ident(clsLocation), List(Literal(Constant(pos.source.path)), Literal(Constant(pos.line)), Literal(Constant(pos.column)))))
 *    }
 *  }
 * }}}
 *
 * ''Of Note:'' There are several high-level alternatives that one can use to avoid having to manually
 * lookup symbols. For example, `typeOf[Location.type].termSymbol` (or `typeOf[Location].typeSymbol`
 * if we needed a `ClassSymbol`), which are type safe since we don’t have to use `String`s to lookup
 * the `Symbol`.
 *
 * === Runtime Mirrors ===
 *
 * Runtime `Mirror`s make use of both classloader and invoker `Mirror`s.
 *
 * The entry point to `Mirror`s for use at runtime is via `ru.runtimeMirror(<classloader>)`, where
 * `ru` is [[scala.reflect.runtime.universe]].
 *
 * The result of a [[scala.reflect.api.JavaMirrors#runtimeMirror]] call is a classloader mirror,
 * of type [[scala.reflect.api.Mirrors#ReflectiveMirror]], which can load symbols by names as
 * discussed above (in the “Compile-time” section).
 *
 * A classloader mirror can create invoker mirrors, which include: [[scala.reflect.api.Mirrors#InstanceMirror]],
 * [[scala.reflect.api.Mirrors#MethodMirror]], [[scala.reflect.api.Mirrors#FieldMirror]],
 * [[scala.reflect.api.Mirrors#ClassMirror]] and [[scala.reflect.api.Mirrors#ModuleMirror]].
 *
 * Examples of how these two types of `Mirror`s interact are available below.
 *
 * === Types of Mirrors, Their Use Cases & Examples ===
 *
 * '''[[scala.reflect.api.Mirrors#ReflectiveMirror]]'''. Used for loading `Symbol`s by name, and
 * as an entry point into invoker mirrors. Entry point: `val m = ru.runtimeMirror(<classloader>)`.
 * Example:
 * {{{
 *   scala> val ru = scala.reflect.runtime.universe
 *   ru: scala.reflect.api.JavaUniverse = ...
 *
 *   scala> val m = ru.runtimeMirror(getClass.getClassLoader)
 *   m: reflect.runtime.universe.Mirror = JavaMirror ...
 * }}}
 *
 * '''[[scala.reflect.api.Mirrors#InstanceMirror]]'''. Used for creating invoker `Mirror`s for methods
 * and fields and for inner classes and inner objects (modules). Entry point: `val im = m.reflect(<value>)`.
 * Example:
 * {{{
 *   scala> class C { def x = 2 }
 *   defined class C
 *
 *   scala> val im = m.reflect(new C)
 *   im: reflect.runtime.universe.InstanceMirror = instance mirror for C@3442299e
 * }}}
 *
 * '''[[scala.reflect.api.Mirrors#MethodMirror]]'''. Used for invoking instance methods (Scala only has
 * instance methods-- methods of objects are instance methods of object instances, obtainable
 * via `ModuleMirror.instance`). Entry point: `val mm = im.reflectMethod(<method symbol>)`.
 * Example:
 * {{{
 *   scala> val methodX = typeOf[C].declaration(newTermName("x")).asMethod
 *   methodX: reflect.runtime.universe.MethodSymbol = method x
 *
 *   scala> val mm = im.reflectMethod(methodX)
 *   mm: reflect.runtime.universe.MethodMirror = method mirror for C.x: scala.Int (bound to C@3442299e)
 *
 *   scala> mm()
 *   res0: Any = 2
 * }}}
 *
 * '''[[scala.reflect.api.Mirrors#FieldMirror]]'''. Used for getting/setting instance fields
 * (Scala only has instance fields-- fields of objects are instance methods of object instances
 * obtainable via ModuleMirror.instance). Entry point:
 * `val fm = im.reflectMethod(<field or accessor symbol>)`.
 * Example:
 * {{{
 *   scala> class C { val x = 2; val y = 3 }
 *   defined class C
 *
 *   scala> val m = ru.runtimeMirror(getClass.getClassLoader)
 *   m: reflect.runtime.universe.Mirror = JavaMirror ...
 *
 *   scala> val im = m.reflect(new C)
 *   im: reflect.runtime.universe.InstanceMirror = instance mirror for C@5f0c8ac1
 *
 *   scala> val fieldX = typeOf[C].declaration(newTermName("x")).asTerm.accessed.asTerm
 *   fieldX: reflect.runtime.universe.TermSymbol = value x
 *   scala> val fmX = im.reflectField(fieldX)
 *   fmX: reflect.runtime.universe.FieldMirror = field mirror for C.x (bound to C@5f0c8ac1)
 *
 *   scala> fmX.get
 *   res0: Any = 2
 *
 *   scala> fmX.set(3)
 *   scala.ScalaReflectionException: cannot set an immutable field x
 *   ...
 *
 *   scala> val fieldY = typeOf[C].declaration(newTermName("y")).asTerm.accessed.asTerm
 *   fieldY: reflect.runtime.universe.TermSymbol = variable y
 *
 *   scala> val fmY = im.reflectField(fieldY)
 *   fmY: reflect.runtime.universe.FieldMirror = field mirror for C.y (bound to C@5f0c8ac1)
 *
 *   scala> fmY.get
 *   res1: Any = 3
 *
 *   scala> fmY.set(4)
 *
 *   scala> fmY.get
 *   res2: Any = 4
 * }}}
 *
 * '''[[scala.reflect.api.Mirrors#ClassMirror]]'''. Used for creating invoker mirrors for constructors.
 * Entry points: for ''static classes'' `val cm1 = m.reflectClass(<class symbol>)`,
 * for ''inner classes'' `val mm2 = im.reflectClass(<module symbol>)`.
 * Example:
 * {{{
 *   scala> case class C(x: Int)
 *   defined class C
 *
 *   scala> val m = ru.runtimeMirror(getClass.getClassLoader)
 *   m: reflect.runtime.universe.Mirror = JavaMirror ...
 *
 *   scala> val classC = typeOf[C].typeSymbol.asClass
 *
 *   classC: reflect.runtime.universe.Symbol = class C
 *
 *   scala> val cm = m.reflectClass(classC)
 *   cm: reflect.runtime.universe.ClassMirror = class mirror for C (bound to null)
 *
 *   scala> val ctorC = typeOf[C].declaration(ru.nme.CONSTRUCTOR).asMethod
 *   ctorC: reflect.runtime.universe.MethodSymbol = constructor C
 *
 *   scala> val ctorm = cm.reflectConstructor(ctorC)
 *   ctorm: reflect.runtime.universe.MethodMirror = constructor mirror for C.<init>(x: scala.Int): C (bound to null)
 *
 *   scala> ctorm(2)
 *   res0: Any = C(2)
 * }}}
 *
 * '''[[scala.reflect.api.Mirrors#ModuleMirror]]'''. Used for getting singleton instances of objects.
 * Entry points: for ''static objects (modules)'' `val mm1 = m.reflectModule(<module symbol>)`,
 * for ''inner objects (modules)'' `val mm2 = im.reflectModule(<module symbol>)`.
 * Example:
 * {{{
 *   scala> object C { def x = 2 }
 *   defined module C
 *
 *   scala> val m = ru.runtimeMirror(getClass.getClassLoader)
 *   m: reflect.runtime.universe.Mirror = JavaMirror ...
 *
 *   scala> val objectC = typeOf[C.type].termSymbol.asModule
 *   objectC: reflect.runtime.universe.ModuleSymbol = object C
 *
 *   scala> val mm = m.reflectModule(objectC)
 *   mm: reflect.runtime.universe.ModuleMirror = module mirror for C (bound to null)
 *
 *   scala> val obj = mm.instance
 *   obj: Any = C$@1005ec04
 * }}}
