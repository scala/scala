/** The Position class and its subclasses represent positions of ASTs and symbols.
 *  Except for NoPosition and FakePos, every position refers to a SourceFile
 *  and to an offset in the sourcefile (its `point`). For batch compilation,
 *  that's all. For interactive IDE's there are also RangePositions
 *  and TransparentPositions. A RangePosition indicates a start and an end
 *  in addition to its point. TransparentPositions are a subclass of RangePositions.
 *  Range positions that are not transparent are called opaque.
 *  Trees with RangePositions need to satisfy the following invariants.
 *
 *  INV1: A tree with an offset position never contains a child
 *        with a range position
 *  INV2: If the child of a tree with a range position also has a range position,
 *        then the child's range is contained in the parent's range.
 *  INV3: Opaque range positions of children of the same node are non-overlapping
 *        (this means their overlap is at most a single point).
 *
 *  The following tests are useful on positions:
 *
 *  pos.isDefined     true if position is not a NoPosition nor a FakePosition
 *  pos.isRange       true if position is a range
 *  pos.isOpaqueRange true if position is an opaque range
 *
 *  The following accessor methods are provided:
 *
 *  pos.source        The source file of the position, which must be defined
 *  pos.point         The offset of the position's point, which must be defined
 *  pos.start         The start of the position, which must be a range
 *  pos.end           The end of the position, which must be a range
 *
 *  There are also convenience methods, such as
 *
 *  pos.startOrPoint
 *  pos.endOrPoint
 *  pos.pointOrElse(default)
 *
 *  These are less strict about the kind of position on which they can be applied.
 *
 *  The following conversion methods are often used:
 *
 *  pos.focus           converts a range position to an offset position, keeping its point;
 *                      returns all other positions unchanged.
 *  pos.makeTransparent converts an opaque range position into a transparent one.
 *                      returns all other positions unchanged.
