 *
 *  Position tracks the origin of [[Symbols#Symbol symbols]] and [[Trees#Tree tree nodes]]. They are commonly used when
 *  displaying warnings and errors, to indicate the incorrect point in the program.
 *
 *  Every non-empty position refers to a SourceFile and three character
 *  offsets within it: start, end, and point. The point is where the ^ belongs when
 *  issuing an error message, usually a Name. A range position can be designated
 *  as transparent, which excuses it from maintaining the invariants to follow. If
 *  a transparent position has opaque children, those are considered as if they were
 *  the direct children of the transparent position's parent.
 *
 *  Note: some of these invariants actually apply to the trees which carry
 *  the positions, but they are phrased as if the positions themselves were
 *  the parent/children for conciseness.
 *
 *  Invariant 1: in a focused/offset position, start == point == end
 *  Invariant 2: in a range position,          start <= point <  end
 *  Invariant 3: an offset position never has a child with a range position
 *  Invariant 4: every range position child of a range position parent is contained within its parent
 *  Invariant 5: opaque range position siblings overlap at most at a single point
 *
 *  The following tests are useful on positions:
 *
 *  pos.isDefined     true if position is not an UndefinedPosition (those being NoPosition and FakePos)
 *  pos.isRange       true if position is a range (opaque or transparent) which implies start < end
 *  pos.isOpaqueRange true if position is an opaque range
 *
 *  The following accessor methods are provided - an exception will be thrown if
 *  point/start/end are attempted on an UndefinedPosition.
 *
 *  pos.source       The source file of the position, or NoSourceFile if unavailable
 *  pos.point        The offset of the point
 *  pos.start        The (inclusive) start offset, or the point of an offset position
 *  pos.end          The (exclusive) end offset, or the point of an offset position
 *
 *  The following conversion methods are often used:
 *
 *  pos.focus           Converts a range position to an offset position focused on the point
 *  pos.makeTransparent Convert an opaque range into a transparent range
 *
 *  For more information about `Position`s, see the [[http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/reflection/annotations-names-scopes.html Reflection Guide: Annotations, Names, Scopes, and More]]
