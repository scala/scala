/**
 * <span class="badge badge-red" style="float: right;">EXPERIMENTAL</span>
 *
 * This trait provides support for scopes in the reflection API.
 *
 * A scope object generally maps names to symbols available in a corresponding lexical scope.
 * Scopes can be nested. The base type exposed to the reflection API, however,
 * only exposes a minimal interface, representing a scope as an iterable of symbols.
 *
 * For rare occasions when it is necessary to create a scope manually,
 * e.g., to populate members of [[scala.reflect.api.Types#RefinedType]],
 * there is the `newScopeWith` function.
 *
 * Additional functionality is exposed in member scopes that are returned by
 * `members` and `decls` defined in [[scala.reflect.api.Types#TypeApi]].
 * Such scopes support the `sorted` method, which sorts members in declaration order.
 *
