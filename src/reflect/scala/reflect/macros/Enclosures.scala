/**
 * <span class="badge badge-red" style="float: right;">EXPERIMENTAL</span>
 *
 *  A slice of [[scala.reflect.macros.blackbox.Context the Scala macros context]] that exposes
 *  enclosing trees (method, class, compilation unit and currently compiled macro application),
 *  the enclosing position of the macro expansion, as well as macros and implicits
 *  that are currently in-flight.
 *
 *  Starting from Scala 2.11.0, the APIs to get the trees enclosing by the current macro application are deprecated,
 *  and the reasons for that are two-fold. Firstly, we would like to move towards the philosophy of locally-expanded macros,
 *  as it has proven to be important for understanding of code. Secondly, within the current architecture of scalac,
 *  we are unable to have c.enclosingTree-style APIs working robustly. Required changes to the typechecker would greatly
 *  exceed the effort that we would like to expend on this feature given the existence of more pressing concerns at the moment.
 *  This is somewhat aligned with the overall evolution of macros during the 2.11 development cycle, where we played with
 *  `c.introduceTopLevel` and `c.introduceMember`, but at the end of the day decided to reject them.
 *
 *  If you're relying on the now deprecated APIs, consider using the new [[c.internal.enclosingOwner]] method that can be used to obtain
 *  the names of enclosing definitions. Alternatively try reformulating your macros in terms of completely local expansion
 *  and/or joining a discussion of a somewhat related potential language feature at [[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/scala-debate/f4CLmYShX6Q]].
 *  We also welcome questions and suggestions on our mailing lists, where we would be happy to further discuss this matter.

   *  Is also priceless for emitting sane error messages for macros that are called by other macros on synthetic (i.e. position-less) trees.
   *  In that dire case navigate the `enclosingMacros` stack, and it will most likely contain at least one macro with a position-ful macro application.
   *  See `enclosingPosition` for a default implementation of this logic.
   *
   *  Unlike `openMacros`, this is a val, which means that it gets initialized when the context is created
   *  and always stays the same regardless of whatever happens during macro expansion.
