/**
 * <span class="badge badge-red" style="float: right;">EXPERIMENTAL</span>
 *
 *  The base package for Scala macros.
 *
 *  Macros are functions that are called by the compiler during compilation.
 *  Within these functions the programmer has access to compiler APIs exposed in [[scala.reflect.macros.Context]].
 *  For example, it is possible to generate, analyze and typecheck code.
 *
 *  See the [[http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros.html Macros Guide]] on how to get started with Scala macros.
