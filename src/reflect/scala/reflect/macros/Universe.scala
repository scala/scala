     *  @PP: Attempting to elaborate on the above, I find: If defineType
     *  is called on a TypeTree whose type field is null or NoType,
     *  this is recorded as "wasEmpty = true". That value is used in
     *  ResetAttrsTraverser, which nulls out the type field of TypeTrees
     *  for which wasEmpty is true, leaving the others alone.
     *
     *  resetAllAttrs is used in situations where some speculative
     *  typing of a tree takes place, fails, and the tree needs to be
     *  returned to its former state to try again. So according to me:
     *  using `defineType` instead of `setType` is how you communicate
     *  that the type being set does not depend on any previous state,
     *  and therefore should be abandoned if the current line of type
     *  inquiry doesn't work out.
