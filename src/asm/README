Upgrading ASM
-------------

Check the commit history of src/asm: https://github.com/scala/scala/commits/2.11.x/src/asm.
Find the previous commit that upgraded ASM and take a look at its commit message. It should
be a squashed version of a pull request that shows the precise procedure how the last upgrade
was made.

Start by deleting all source files in src/asm/ and copy the ones from the latest ASM release.

Excluded Files (don't copy):
  - package.html files
  - org/objectweb/asm/commons, but keep CodeSizeEvaluator.java
  - org/objectweb/asm/optimizer
  - org/objectweb/asm/xml

Re-packaging and cosmetic changes:
  - convert line endings (there are some CRLF)
    find src/asm/scala/tools/asm -name '*.java' | xargs dos2unix
  - change package clauses
    find src/asm/scala/tools/asm -name '*.java' | xargs sed -i '' -e 's/package org\.objectweb\.asm/package scala.tools.asm/'
  - update imports
    find src/asm/scala/tools/asm -name '*.java' | xargs sed -i '' -e 's/import org\.objectweb\.asm/import scala.tools.asm/'
  - update @links, @associates
    find src/asm/scala/tools/asm -name '*.java' | xargs sed -i '' -e 's/@link org\.objectweb\.asm/@link scala.tools.asm/'
    find src/asm/scala/tools/asm -name '*.java' | xargs sed -i '' -e 's/@associates org\.objectweb\.asm/@associates scala.tools.asm/'
  - remove trailing whitespace
    find src/asm/scala/tools/asm -name '*.java' | xargs sed -i '' -e 's/[ ]*$//'

Include the actual changes that we have in our repostiory
  - Include the commits labelled [asm-cherry-pick] in the non-squashed PR of the previous upgrade
  - Include the changes that were added to src/asm since the last upgrade and label them [asm-cherry-pick]
