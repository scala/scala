/**
 * An annotation that marks a member as having changed semantics

 * reason or another retain the same name and type signature,
 * but some aspect of their behavior is different.  An illustrative
 * examples is Stack.iterator, which reversed from LIFO to FIFO
 * order between Scala 2.7 and 2.8.
 *
 * @param message A message describing the change, which is emitted
 * by the compiler if the flag `-Xmigration` is set.
 *
 * @param changedIn The version, in which the behaviour change was
 * introduced.

 * @since 2.8
