 *  elements to the builder with `+=` and then converting to the required
 *  collection type with `result`.
 *
 *  One cannot assume that a single `Builder` can build more than one
 *  instance of the desired collection.  Particular subclasses may allow
 *  such behavior.  Otherwise, `result` should be treated as a terminal
 *  operation: after it is called, no further methods should be called on
 *  the builder.  Extend the [[collection.mutable.ReusableBuilder]] trait
 *  instead of `Builder` for builders that may be reused to build multiple
 *  instances.
 *
 *  @tparam  Elem  the type of elements that get added to the builder.
 *  @tparam  To    the type of collection that it produced.
