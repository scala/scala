/** `ReusableBuilder` is a marker trait that indicates that a `Builder`
  *  can be reused to build more than one instance of a collection.  In
  *  particular, calling `result` followed by `clear` will produce a
  *  collection and reset the builder to begin building a new collection
  *  of the same type.
  *
  *  It is up to subclasses to implement this behavior, and to document any
  *  other behavior that varies from standard `ReusableBuilder` usage
  *  (e.g. operations being well-defined after a call to `result`, or allowing
  *  multiple calls to result to obtain different snapshots of a collection under
  *  construction).
  *
  *  @tparam  Elem  the type of elements that get added to the builder.
  *  @tparam  To    the type of collection that it produced.
  *
  *  @since 2.12
