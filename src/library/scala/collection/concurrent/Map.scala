  *  This is a base trait for all Scala concurrent map implementations. It
  *  provides all of the methods a `Map` does, with the difference that all the
  *  changes are atomic. It also describes methods specific to concurrent maps.
  *
  *  '''Note''': The concurrent maps do not accept `'''null'''` for keys or values.
  *
  *  @define atomicop
  *  This is an atomic operation.
