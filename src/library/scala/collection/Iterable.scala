/** This trait provides default implementations for the factory methods `fromSpecific` and
  * `newSpecificBuilder` that need to be refined when implementing a collection type that refines
  * the `CC` and `C` type parameters. It is used for sorted maps.
  *
  * Note that in sorted maps, the `CC` type of the map is not the same as the `CC` type for the
  * underlying map (which is fixed to `Map` in [[SortedMapOps]]). This trait has therefore
  * three type parameters `CC`, `WithFilterCC` and `UnsortedCC`. The `withFilter` method inherited
  * from `IterableOps` is overridden with a compatible default implementation.
  *
  * The default implementations in this trait can be used in the common case when `CC[A]` is the
  * same as `C`.
