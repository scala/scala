/** The class `Stream` implements lazy lists where elements
 *  are only evaluated when they are needed. Here is an example:
 *
 *  {{{
 *  import scala.math.BigInt
 *  object Main extends App {
 *
 *    val fibs: Stream[BigInt] = BigInt(0) #:: BigInt(1) #:: fibs.zip(fibs.tail).map { n => n._1 + n._2 }
 *
 *    fibs take 5 foreach println
 *  }
 *
 *  // prints
 *  //
 *  // 0
 *  // 1
 *  // 1
 *  // 2
 *  // 3
 *  }}}
 *
 *  The `Stream` class also employs memoization such that previously computed
 *  values are converted from `Stream` elements to concrete values of type `A`.
 *  To illustrate, we will alter body of the `fibs` value above and take some
 *  more values:
 *
 *  {{{
 *  import scala.math.BigInt
 *  object Main extends App {
 *
 *    val fibs: Stream[BigInt] = BigInt(0) #:: BigInt(1) #:: fibs.zip(
 *      fibs.tail).map(n => {
 *        println("Adding %d and %d".format(n._1, n._2))
 *        n._1 + n._2
 *      })
 *
 *    fibs take 5 foreach println
 *    fibs take 6 foreach println
 *  }
 *
 *  // prints
 *  //
 *  // 0
 *  // 1
 *  // Adding 0 and 1
 *  // 1
 *  // Adding 1 and 1
 *  // 2
 *  // Adding 1 and 2
 *  // 3
 *
 *  // And then prints
 *  //
 *  // 0
 *  // 1
 *  // 1
 *  // 2
 *  // 3
 *  // Adding 2 and 3
 *  // 5
 *  }}}
 *
 *  There are a number of subtle points to the above example.
 *
 *  - The definition of `fibs` is a `val` not a method.  The memoization of the
 *  `Stream` requires us to have somewhere to store the information and a `val`
 *  allows us to do that.
 *
 *  - While the `Stream` is actually being modified during access, this does not
 *  change the notion of its immutability.  Once the values are memoized they do
 *  not change and values that have yet to be memoized still "exist", they
 *  simply haven't been realized yet.
 *
 *  - One must be cautious of memoization; you can very quickly eat up large
 *  amounts of memory if you're not careful.  The reason for this is that the
 *  memoization of the `Stream` creates a structure much like
 *  [[scala.collection.immutable.List]].  So long as something is holding on to
 *  the head, the head holds on to the tail, and so it continues recursively.
 *  If, on the other hand, there is nothing holding on to the head (e.g. we used
 *  `def` to define the `Stream`) then once it is no longer being used directly,
 *  it disappears.
 *
 *  - Note that some operations, including [[drop]], [[dropWhile]],
 *  [[flatMap]] or [[collect]] may process a large number of intermediate
 *  elements before returning.  These necessarily hold onto the head, since
 *  they are methods on `Stream`, and a stream holds its own head.  For
 *  computations of this sort where memoization is not desired, use
 *  `Iterator` when possible.
 *
 *  {{{
 *  // For example, let's build the natural numbers and do some silly iteration
 *  // over them.
 *
 *  // We'll start with a silly iteration
 *  def loop(s: String, i: Int, iter: Iterator[Int]): Unit = {
 *    // Stop after 200,000
 *    if (i < 200001) {
 *      if (i % 50000 == 0) println(s + i)
 *      loop(s, iter.next, iter)
 *    }
 *  }
 *
 *  // Our first Stream definition will be a val definition
 *  val stream1: Stream[Int] = {
 *    def loop(v: Int): Stream[Int] = v #:: loop(v + 1)
 *    loop(0)
 *  }
 *
 *  // Because stream1 is a val, everything that the iterator produces is held
 *  // by virtue of the fact that the head of the Stream is held in stream1
 *  val it1 = stream1.iterator
 *  loop("Iterator1: ", it1.next, it1)
 *
 *  // We can redefine this Stream such that all we have is the Iterator left
 *  // and allow the Stream to be garbage collected as required.  Using a def
 *  // to provide the Stream ensures that no val is holding onto the head as
 *  // is the case with stream1
 *  def stream2: Stream[Int] = {
 *    def loop(v: Int): Stream[Int] = v #:: loop(v + 1)
 *    loop(0)
 *  }
 *  val it2 = stream2.iterator
 *  loop("Iterator2: ", it2.next, it2)
 *
 *  // And, of course, we don't actually need a Stream at all for such a simple
 *  // problem.  There's no reason to use a Stream if you don't actually need
 *  // one.
 *  val it3 = new Iterator[Int] {
 *    var i = -1
 *    def hasNext = true
 *    def next(): Int = { i += 1; i }
 *  }
 *  loop("Iterator3: ", it3.next, it3)
 *  }}}
 *
 *  - The fact that `tail` works at all is of interest.  In the definition of
 *  `fibs` we have an initial `(0, 1, Stream(...))` so `tail` is deterministic.
 *  If we defined `fibs` such that only `0` were concretely known then the act
 *  of determining `tail` would require the evaluation of `tail` which would
 *  cause an infinite recursion and stack overflow.  If we define a definition
 *  where the tail is not initially computable then we're going to have an
 *  infinite recursion:
 *  {{{
 *  // The first time we try to access the tail we're going to need more
 *  // information which will require us to recurse, which will require us to
 *  // recurse, which...
 *  val sov: Stream[Vector[Int]] = Vector(0) #:: sov.zip(sov.tail).map { n => n._1 ++ n._2 }
 *  }}}
 *
 *  The definition of `fibs` above creates a larger number of objects than
 *  necessary depending on how you might want to implement it.  The following
 *  implementation provides a more "cost effective" implementation due to the
 *  fact that it has a more direct route to the numbers themselves:
 *
 *  {{{
 *  lazy val fib: Stream[Int] = {
 *    def loop(h: Int, n: Int): Stream[Int] = h #:: loop(n, h + n)
 *    loop(1, 1)
 *  }
 *  }}}
 *
 *  Note that `mkString` forces evaluation of a `Stream`, but `addString` does
 *  not.  In both cases, a `Stream` that is or ends in a cycle
 *  (e.g. `lazy val s: Stream[Int] = 0 #:: s`) will convert additional trips
 *  through the cycle to `...`.  Additionally, `addString` will display an
 *  un-memoized tail as `?`.
 *
 *  @tparam A    the type of the elements contained in this stream.
