  /**
    * A branch node of the HashTrieSet with at least one and up to 32 children.
    *
    * @param bitmap encodes which element corresponds to which child
    * @param elems the up to 32 children of this node.
    *              the number of children must be identical to the number of 1 bits in bitmap
    * @param size0 the total number of elements. This is stored just for performance reasons.
    * @tparam A      the type of the elements contained in this hash set.
    *
    * How levels work:
    *
    * When looking up or adding elements, the part of the hashcode that is used to address the children array depends
    * on how deep we are in the tree. This is accomplished by having a level parameter in all internal methods
    * that starts at 0 and increases by 5 (32 = 2^5) every time we go deeper into the tree.
    *
    * hashcode (binary): 00000000000000000000000000000000
    * level=0 (depth=0)                             ^^^^^
    * level=5 (depth=1)                        ^^^^^
    * level=10 (depth=2)                  ^^^^^
    * ...
    *
    * Be careful: a non-toplevel HashTrieSet is not a self-contained set, so e.g. calling contains on it will not work!
    * It relies on its depth in the Trie for which part of a hash to use to address the children, but this information
    * (the level) is not stored due to storage efficiency reasons but has to be passed explicitly!
    *
    * How bitmap and elems correspond:
    *
    * A naive implementation of a HashTrieSet would always have an array of size 32 for children and leave the unused
    * children empty (null). But that would be very wasteful regarding memory. Instead, only non-empty children are
    * stored in elems, and the bitmap is used to encode which elem corresponds to which child bucket. The lowest 1 bit
    * corresponds to the first element, the second-lowest to the second, etc.
    *
    * bitmap (binary): 00010000000000000000100000000000
    * elems: [a,b]
    * children:        ---b----------------a-----------
