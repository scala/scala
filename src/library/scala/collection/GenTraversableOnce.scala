   *  element type. In addition, it allows parallel collections to be processed
   *  in chunks, and then combines the intermediate results.
   *
   *  `aggregate` splits the $coll into partitions and processes each
   *  partition by sequentially applying `seqop`, starting with `z` (like

   *  character to an Int and adds it to the sum (of the partition). Then,
   *  `combop` just needs to sum up the intermediate results of the partitions:

   *                   `Nil` for list concatenation or `0` for summation) and may be evaluated
