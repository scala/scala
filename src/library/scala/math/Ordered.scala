/** A trait for data that have a single, natural ordering.  See
 *  [[scala.math.Ordering]] before using this trait for
 *  more information about whether to use [[scala.math.Ordering]] instead.
 *
 *  Classes that implement this trait can be sorted with
 *  [[scala.util.Sorting]] and can be compared with standard comparison operators
 *  (e.g. > and <).
 *
 *  Ordered should be used for data with a single, natural ordering (like
 *  integers) while Ordering allows for multiple ordering implementations.
 *  An Ordering instance will be implicitly created if necessary.
 *
 *  [[scala.math.Ordering]] is an alternative to this trait that allows multiple orderings to be
 *  defined for the same type.
 *
 *  [[scala.math.PartiallyOrdered]] is an alternative to this trait for partially ordered data.
 *
 *  For example, create a simple class that implements `Ordered` and then sort it with [[scala.util.Sorting]]:
 *  {{{
 *  case class OrderedClass(n:Int) extends Ordered[OrderedClass] {
 *  	def compare(that: OrderedClass) =  this.n - that.n
 *  }
 *
 *  val x = Array(OrderedClass(1), OrderedClass(5), OrderedClass(3))
 *  scala.util.Sorting.quickSort(x)
 *  x
 *  }}}
 *
 *  It is important that the `equals` method for an instance of `Ordered[A]` be consistent with the
 *  compare method. However, due to limitations inherent in the type erasure semantics, there is no
 *  reasonable way to provide a default implementation of equality for instances of `Ordered[A]`.
 *  Therefore, if you need to be able to use equality on an instance of `Ordered[A]` you must
 *  provide it yourself either when inheriting or instantiating.
 *
 *  It is important that the `hashCode` method for an instance of `Ordered[A]` be consistent with
 *  the `compare` method. However, it is not possible to provide a sensible default implementation.
 *  Therefore, if you need to be able compute the hash of an instance of `Ordered[A]` you must
 *  provide it yourself either when inheriting or instantiating.
