/** A trait for totally ordered data.
 *
 * Note that since version 2006-07-24 this trait is no longer covariant in a.
 *
 * It is important that the equals method for an instance of
 * Ordered[A] be consistent with the compare method.  However,
 * due to limitations inherent in the type erasure semantics,
 * there is no reasonable way to provide a default implementation
 * of equality for instances of Ordered[A].  Therefore, if you need
 * to be able to use equality on an instance of Ordered[A] you must
 * provide it yourself either when inheriting or instantiating.
 *
 * It is important that the hashCode method for an instance of
 * Ordered[A] be consistent with the compare method. However,
 * it is not possible to provide a sensible default implementation.
 * Therefore, if you need to be able compute the hash of an
 * instance of Ordered[A] you must provide it yourself either when
 * inheriting or instantiating.
