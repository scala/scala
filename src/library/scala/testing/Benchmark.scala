/** `Benchmark` can be used to quickly turn an existing class into a
 *  benchmark. Here is a short example:
 *  {{{
 *  object sort1 extends Sorter with Benchmark {
 *    def run = sort(List.range(1, 1000))
 *  }
 *  }}}
 *  The `run` method has to be defined by the user, who will perform the
 *  timed operation there. Run the benchmark as follows:
 *  {{{
 *  > scala sort1 5
 *  }}}
 *  This will run the benchmark 5 times, forcing a garbage collection
 *  between runs, and printing the execution times to stdout.
 *
 *  It is also possible to add a multiplier, so
 *  {{{
 *  > scala sort1 5 10
 *  }}}
 *  will run the entire benchmark 10 times, each time for 5 runs.
