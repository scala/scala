/** A trait that manages names.
 *  A name is a string in one of two name universes: terms and types.
 *  The same string can be a name in both universes.
 *  Two names are equal if they represent the same string and they are
 *  members of the same universe.
 * 
 *  Names are interned. That is, for two names `name11 and `name2`,
 *  `name1 == name2` implies `name1 eq name2`.
