/** An `ArrayTag[T]` is a descriptor that is requested by the compiler every time
 *  when an array is instantiated, but the element type is unknown at compile time.
 *
 *  Implicit in the contract of `ArrayTag[T]` is the fact that `T`
 *  cannot contain unresolved references to type parameters or abstract types.
 *
 *  Scala library provides a standard implementation of this trait,
 *  `ClassTag[T]` that explicitly carries the runtime class of type T
 *  and uses reflection to instantiate arrays.
 *
 *  However other platforms (e.g. a Scala -> JS crosscompiler) may reimplement this trait as they see fit
 *  and then expose the implementation via an implicit macro.
 *
 * @see [[scala.reflect.base.TypeTags]]
