/**
 * An `ExecutionContext` can execute program logic asynchronously,
 * typically but not necessarily on a thread pool.
 *
 * A general purpose `ExecutionContext` must be asynchronous in executing
 * any `Runnable` that is passed into its `execute`-method. A special purpose
 * `ExecutionContext` may be synchronous but must only be passed to code that
 * is explicitly safe to be run using a synchronously executing `ExecutionContext`.
 *
 * APIs such as `Future.onComplete` require you to provide a callback
 * and an implicit `ExecutionContext`. The implicit `ExecutionContext`
 * will be used to execute the callback.
 *
 * While it is possible to simply import
 * `scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global` to obtain an
 * implicit `ExecutionContext`, application developers should carefully
 * consider where they want to define the execution policy;
 * ideally, one place per application — or per logically related section of code —
 * will make a decision about which `ExecutionContext` to use.
 * That is, you will mostly want to avoid hardcoding, especially via an import,
 * `scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global`.
 * The recommended approach is to add `(implicit ec: ExecutionContext)` to methods,
 * or class constructor parameters, which need an `ExecutionContext`.
 * 
 * Then locally import a specific `ExecutionContext` in one place for the entire
 * application or module, passing it implicitly to individual methods.
 * Alternatively define a local implicit val with the required `ExecutionContext`.
 *
 * A custom `ExecutionContext` may be appropriate to execute code
 * which blocks on IO or performs long-running computations.
 * `ExecutionContext.fromExecutorService` and `ExecutionContext.fromExecutor`
 * are good ways to create a custom `ExecutionContext`.
 *
 * The intent of `ExecutionContext` is to lexically scope code execution.
 * That is, each method, class, file, package, or application determines
 * how to run its own code. This avoids issues such as running
 * application callbacks on a thread pool belonging to a networking library.
 * The size of a networking library's thread pool can be safely configured,
 * knowing that only that library's network operations will be affected.
 * Application callback execution can be configured separately.

@implicitNotFound("""Cannot find an implicit ExecutionContext. You might add
an (implicit ec: ExecutionContext) parameter to your method.

The ExecutionContext is used to configure how and on which
thread pools asynchronous tasks (such as Futures) will run,
so the specific ExecutionContext that is selected is important.

If your application does not define an ExecutionContext elsewhere,
consider using Scala's global ExecutionContext by defining
the following:

implicit val ec: scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext = scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.global""")
trait ExecutionContext {

  /** Runs a block of code on this execution context.
   *
   *  @param runnable  the task to execute
   */
  def execute(runnable: Runnable): Unit

  /** Reports that an asynchronous computation failed.
   *
   *  @param cause  the cause of the failure
   */
  def reportFailure(@deprecatedName("t") cause: Throwable): Unit

  /** Prepares for the execution of a task. Returns the prepared
     *  execution context. The recommended implementation of
     *  `prepare` is to return `this`.
     *
     *  This method should no longer be overridden or called. It was
     *  originally expected that `prepare` would be called by
     *  all libraries that consume ExecutionContexts, in order to
     *  capture thread local context. However, this usage has proven
     *  difficult to implement in practice and instead it is
     *  now better to avoid using `prepare` entirely.
     *
     *  Instead, if an `ExecutionContext` needs to capture thread
     *  local context, it should capture that context when it is
     *  constructed, so that it doesn't need any additional
     *  preparation later.

   * The global [[ExecutionContext]]. This default `ExecutionContext` implementation is backed by a work-stealing thread

   *
   *   - `scala.concurrent.context.minThreads` = defaults to "1"

   *
   * The `maxExtraThreads` is the maximum number of extra threads to have at any given time to evade deadlock,
   * see [[scala.concurrent.blocking]].
   *

   * == Batching short-lived nested tasks ==
   *
   * Asynchronous code with short-lived nested tasks is executed more efficiently when using
   * `ExecutionContext.opportunistic` (continue reading to learn why it is `private[scala]` and how to access it).
   *
   * `ExecutionContext.opportunistic` uses the same thread pool as `ExecutionContext.global`. It attempts to batch
   * nested task and execute them on the same thread as the enclosing task. This is ideally suited to execute
   * short-lived tasks as it reduces the overhead of context switching.
   *
   * WARNING: long-running and/or blocking tasks should be demarcated within [[scala.concurrent.blocking]]-blocks
   *          to ensure that any pending tasks in the current batch can be executed by another thread on `global`.
   *
   * === How to use ===
   *
   * This field is `private[scala]` to maintain binary compatibility. It was added in 2.13.4, code that references it
   * directly fails to run with a 2.13.0-3 Scala library.
   *
   * Libraries should not reference this field directly because users of the library might be using an earlier Scala
   * version. In order to use the batching `ExecutionContext` in a library, the code needs to fall back to `global`
   * in case the `opportunistic` field is missing (example below). The resulting `ExecutionContext` has batching
   * behavior in all Scala 2.13 versions (`global` is batching in 2.13.0-3).
   *
   * {{{
   * implicit val ec: scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext = try {
   *   scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.getClass
   *     .getDeclaredMethod("opportunistic")
   *     .invoke(scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext)
   *     .asInstanceOf[scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext]
   * } catch {
   *   case _: NoSuchMethodException =>
   *     scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.global
   * }
   * }}}
   *
   * Application authors can safely use the field because the Scala version at run time is the same as at compile time.
   * Options to bypass the access restriction include:
   *
   *   1. Using a structural type (example below). This uses reflection at run time.
   *   1. Writing a Scala `object` in the `scala` package (example below).
   *   1. Writing a Java source file. This works because `private[scala]` is emitted as `public` in Java bytecode.
   *
   * {{{
   * // Option 1
   * implicit val ec: scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext =
   *   (scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext:
   *     {def opportunistic: scala.concurrent.ExecutionContextExecutor}
   *   ).opportunistic

   * // Option 2

   * WARNING: Only ever execute logic which will quickly return control to the caller.
