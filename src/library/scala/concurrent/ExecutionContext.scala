/**
 * An `ExecutionContext` can execute program logic asynchronously,
 * typically but not necessarily on a thread pool.
 *
 * A general purpose `ExecutionContext` must be asynchronous in executing
 * any `Runnable` that is passed into its `execute`-method. A special purpose
 * `ExecutionContext` may be synchronous but must only be passed to code that
 * is explicitly safe to be run using a synchronously executing `ExecutionContext`.
 *
 * APIs such as `Future.onComplete` require you to provide a callback
 * and an implicit `ExecutionContext`. The implicit `ExecutionContext`
 * will be used to execute the callback.
 *
 * It is possible to simply import
 * `scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global` to obtain an
 * implicit `ExecutionContext`. This global context is a reasonable
 * default thread pool.
 *
 * However, application developers should carefully consider where they
 * want to set policy; ideally, one place per application (or per
 * logically-related section of code) will make a decision about
 * which `ExecutionContext` to use. That is, you might want to avoid
 * hardcoding `scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global` all
 * over the place in your code.
 * One approach is to add `(implicit ec: ExecutionContext)`
 * to methods which need an `ExecutionContext`. Then import a specific
 * context in one place for the entire application or module,
 * passing it implicitly to individual methods.
 *
 * A custom `ExecutionContext` may be appropriate to execute code
 * which blocks on IO or performs long-running computations.
 * `ExecutionContext.fromExecutorService` and `ExecutionContext.fromExecutor`
 * are good ways to create a custom `ExecutionContext`.
 *
 * The intent of `ExecutionContext` is to lexically scope code execution.
 * That is, each method, class, file, package, or application determines
 * how to run its own code. This avoids issues such as running
 * application callbacks on a thread pool belonging to a networking library.
 * The size of a networking library's thread pool can be safely configured,
 * knowing that only that library's network operations will be affected.
 * Application callback execution can be configured separately.
