/**
 * <h2>Utility for working with java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit durations.</h2>
 *
 * '''''This class is not meant as a general purpose representation of time, it is
 * optimized for the needs of `scala.concurrent`.'''''
 *
 * <h2>Basic Usage</h2>
 *
 * <p/>
 * Examples:
 * {{{
 * import scala.concurrent.duration._
 *
 * val duration = Duration(100, MILLISECONDS)
 * val duration = Duration(100, "millis")
 *
 * duration.toNanos
 * duration < 1.second
 * duration <= Duration.Inf
 * }}}
 *
 * '''''Invoking inexpressible conversions (like calling `toSeconds` on an infinite duration) will throw an IllegalArgumentException.'''''
 *
 * <p/>
 * Implicits are also provided for Int, Long and Double. Example usage:
 * {{{
 * import scala.concurrent.duration._
 *
 * val duration = 100 millis
 * }}}
 *
 * '''''The DSL provided by the implicit conversions always allows construction of finite durations, even for infinite Double inputs; use Duration.Inf instead.'''''
 *
 * Extractors, parsing and arithmetic are also included:
 * {{{
 * val d = Duration("1.2 µs")
 * val Duration(length, unit) = 5 millis
 * val d2 = d * 2.5
 * val d3 = d2 + 1.millisecond
 * }}}
 *
 * <h2>Handling of Time Units</h2>
 *
 * Calculations performed on finite durations always retain the more precise unit of either operand, no matter
 * whether a coarser unit would be able to exactly express the same duration. This means that Duration can be
 * used as a lossless container for a (length, unit) pair if it is constructed using the corresponding methods
 * and no arithmetic is performed on it; adding/subtracting durations should in that case be done with care.
 *
 * <h2>Correspondence to Double Semantics</h2>
 *
 * The semantics of arithmetic operations on Duration are two-fold:
 *
 *  - exact addition/subtraction with nanosecond resolution for finite durations, independent of the summands' magnitude
 *  - isomorphic to `java.lang.Double` when it comes to infinite or undefined values
 *
 * The conversion between Duration and Double is done using [[Duration.toUnit]] (with unit NANOSECONDS)
 * and [[Duration$.fromNanos(nanos:Double)* Duration.fromNanos(Double)]]
 *
 * <h2>Ordering</h2>
 *
 * The default ordering is consistent with the ordering of Double numbers, which means that Undefined is
 * considered greater than all other durations, including [[Duration.Inf]].
 *
 * @define exc @throws IllegalArgumentException when invoked on a non-finite duration
 *
 * @define ovf @throws IllegalArgumentException in case of a finite overflow: the range of a finite duration is +-(2^63-1)ns, and no conversion to infinite durations takes place.
