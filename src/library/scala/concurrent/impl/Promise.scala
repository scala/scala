  /** Default promise implementation.
   *
   *  A DefaultPromise has three possible states. It can be:
   *
   *  1. Incomplete, with an associated list of callbacks waiting on completion.
   *  2. Complete, with a result.
   *  3. Linked to another DefaultPromise.
   *
   *  If a DefaultPromise is linked to another DefaultPromise, it will
   *  delegate all its operations to that other promise. This means that two
   *  DefaultPromises that are linked will appear, to external callers, to have
   *  exactly the same state and behaviour. For instance, both will appear as
   *  incomplete, or as complete with the same result value.
   *
   *  A DefaultPromise stores its state entirely in the AnyRef cell exposed by
   *  AtomicReference. The type of object stored in the cell fully describes the
   *  current state of the promise.
   *
   *  1. List[CallbackRunnable] - The promise is incomplete and has zero or more callbacks
   *     to call when it is eventually completed.
   *  2. Try[T] - The promise is complete and now contains its value.
   *  3. DefaultPromise[T] - The promise is linked to another promise.
   *
   * The ability to link DefaultPromises is needed to prevent memory leaks when
   * using Future.flatMap. The previous implementation of Future.flatMap used
   * onComplete handlers to propagate the ultimate value of a flatMap operation
   * to its promise. Recursive calls to flatMap built a chain of onComplete
   * handlers and promises. Unfortunately none of the handlers or promises in
   * the chain could be collected until the handlers had been called and
   * detached, which only happened when the final flatMap future was completed.
   * (In some situations, such as infinite streams, this would never actually
   * happen.) Because of the fact that the promise implementation internally
   * created references between promises, and these references were invisible to
   * user code, it was easy for user code to accidentally build large chains of
   * promises and thereby leak memory.
   *
   * The problem of leaks is solved by automatically breaking these chains of
   * promises, so that promises don't refer to each other in a long chain. This
   * allows each promise to be individually collected. The idea is to "flatten"
   * the chain of promises, so that instead of each promise pointing to its
   * neighbour, they instead point directly the promise at the root of the
   * chain. This means that only the root promise is referenced, and all the
   * other promises are available for garbage collection as soon as they're no
   * longer referenced by user code.
   *
   * To make the chains flattenable, the concept of linking promises together
   * needed to become an explicit feature of the DefaultPromise implementation,
   * so that the implementation to navigate and rewire links as needed. The idea
   * of linking promises is based on the [[https://github.com/twitter/util/blob/master/util-core/src/main/scala/com/twitter/util/Promise.scala
   *  Twitter promise implementation]].
   *
   * In practice, flattening the chain cannot always be done perfectly. When a
   * promise is added to the end of the chain, it scans the chain and links
   * directly to the root promise. This prevents the chain from growing forwards
   * But the root promise for a chain can change, causing the chain to grow
   * backwards, and leaving all previously-linked promise pointing at a promise
   * which is no longer the root promise.
   *
   * To mitigate the problem of the root promise changing, whenever a promise's
   * methods are called, and it needs a reference to its root promise it calls
   * the `compressedRoot()` method. This method re-scans the promise chain to
   * get the root promise, and also compresses its links so that it links
   * directly to whatever the current root promise is. This ensures that the
   * chain is flattened whenever `compressedRoot()` is called. And since
   * `compressedRoot()` is called at every possible opportunity (when getting a
   * promise's value, when adding an onComplete handler, etc), this will happen
   * frequently. Unfortunately, even this eager relinking doesn't absolutely
   * guarantee that the chain will be flattened and that leaks cannot occur.
   * However eager relinking does greatly reduce the chance that leaks will
   * occur.
   *
   * Future.flatMap links DefaultPromises together by calling the `linkRootOf`
   * method. This is the only externally visible interface to linked
   * DefaultPromises, and `linkedRootOf` is currently only designed to be called
   * by Future.flatMap.
