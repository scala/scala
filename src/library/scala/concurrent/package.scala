/** This package object contains primitives for concurrent and parallel programming.
 *
 * == Guide ==
 *
 * A more detailed guide to Futures and Promises, including discussion and examples
 * can be found at
 * [[https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html]].
 *
 * == Common Imports ==
 *
 * When working with Futures, you will often find that importing the whole concurrent
 * package is convenient:
 *
 * {{{
 * import scala.concurrent._
 * }}}
 *
 * When using things like `Future`s, it is often required to have an implicit `ExecutionContext`
 * in scope. The general advice for these implicits are as follows.
 *
 * If the code in question is a class or method definition, and no `ExecutionContext` is available,
 * request one from the caller by adding an implicit parameter list:
 *
 * {{{
 * def myMethod(myParam: MyType)(implicit ec: ExecutionContext) = …
 * //Or
 * class MyClass(myParam: MyType)(implicit ec: ExecutionContext) { … }
 * }}}
 *
 * This allows the caller of the method, or creator of the instance of the class, to decide which
 * `ExecutionContext` should be used.
 *
 * For typical REPL usage and experimentation, importing the global `ExecutionContext` is often desired.
 *
 * {{{
 * import scala.concurrent.ExcutionContext.Implicits.global
 * }}}
 *
 * == Specifying Durations ==
 *
 * Operations often require a duration to be specified. A duration DSL is available
 * to make defining these easier:
 *
 * {{{
 * import scala.concurrent.duration._
 * val d: Duration = 10.seconds
 * }}}
 *
 * == Using Futures For Non-blocking Computation ==
 *
 * Basic use of futures is easy with the factory method on Future, which executes a
 * provided function asynchronously, handing you back a future result of that function
 * without blocking the current thread. In order to create the Future you will need
 * either an implicit or explicit ExecutionContext to be provided:
 *
 * {{{
 * import scala.concurrent._
 * import ExecutionContext.Implicits.global  // implicit execution context
 *
 * val firstZebra: Future[Int] = Future {
 *   val words = Files.readAllLines("/etc/dictionaries-common/words").asScala
 *   words.indexOfSlice("zebra")
 * }
 * }}}
 *
 * == Avoid Blocking ==
 *
 * Although blocking is possible in order to await results (with a mandatory timeout duration):
 *
 * {{{
 * import scala.concurrent.duration._
 * Await.result(firstZebra, 10.seconds)
 * }}}
 *
 * and although this is sometimes necessary to do, in particular for testing purposes, blocking
 * in general is discouraged when working with Futures and concurrency in order to avoid
 * potential deadlocks and improve performance. Instead, use callbacks or combinators to
 * remain in the future domain:
 *
 * {{{
 * val animalRange: Future[Int] = for {
 *   aardvark <- firstAardvark
 *   zebra <- firstZebra
 * } yield zebra - aardvark
 *
 * animalRange.onSuccess {
 *   case x if x > 500000 => println("It's a long way from Aardvark to Zebra")
 * }
 * }}}
