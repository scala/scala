/** A `Future` represents a value which may or may not *currently* be available,
 *  but will be available at some point, or an exception if that value could not be made available.
 *
 *  Asynchronous computations that yield futures are created with the `Future.apply` call and are computed using a supplied `ExecutionContext`,
 * which can be backed by a Thread pool.
 *
 *  {{{
 *  import ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
 *  val s = "Hello"

 *  @author  Philipp Haller, Heather Miller, Aleksandar Prokopec, Viktor Klang
 *
 *  @see [[http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html Futures and Promises]]
 *
 *  @define multipleCallbacks
 *  Multiple callbacks may be registered; there is no guarantee that they will be
 *  executed in a particular order.
 *
 *  @define caughtThrowables
 *  This future may contain a throwable object and this means that the future failed.
 *  Futures obtained through combinators have the same exception as the future they were obtained from.
 *  The following throwable objects are not contained in the future:
 *  - `Error` - errors are not contained within futures
 *  - `InterruptedException` - not contained within futures
 *  - all `scala.util.control.ControlThrowable` except `NonLocalReturnControl` - not contained within futures
 *
 *  Instead, the future is completed with a ExecutionException with one of the exceptions above
 *  as the cause.
 *  If a future is failed with a `scala.runtime.NonLocalReturnControl`,
 *  it is completed with a value from that throwable instead.
 *
 *  @define swallowsExceptions
 *  Since this method executes asynchronously and does not produce a return value,
 *  any non-fatal exceptions thrown will be reported to the `ExecutionContext`.
 *
 *  @define nonDeterministic
 *  Note: using this method yields nondeterministic dataflow programs.
 *
 *  @define forComprehensionExamples
 *  Example:
 *
 *  {{{
 *  val f = Future { 5 }
 *  val g = Future { 3 }
 *  val h = for {
 *    x: Int <- f // returns Future(5)
 *    y: Int <- g // returns Future(3)
 *  } yield x + y
 *  }}}
 *
 *  is translated to:
 *
 *  {{{
 *  f flatMap { (x: Int) => g map { (y: Int) => x + y } }
 *  }}}
 *
 * @define callbackInContext
 * The provided callback always runs in the provided implicit
 *`ExecutionContext`, though there is no guarantee that the
 * `execute()` method on the `ExecutionContext` will be called once
 * per callback or that `execute()` will be called in the current
 * thread. That is, the implementation may run multiple callbacks
 * in a batch within a single `execute()` and it may run
 * `execute()` either immediately or asynchronously.
 * Completion of the Future must *happen-before* the invocation of the callback.
