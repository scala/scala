/** The trait that represents futures.
 *
 *  Asynchronous computations that yield futures are created with the `future` call:
 *
 *  {{{
 *  val s = "Hello"
 *  val f: Future[String] = future {
 *    s + " future!"
 *  }
 *  f onSuccess {
 *    case msg => println(msg)
 *  }
 *  }}}
 *
 *  @author  Philipp Haller, Heather Miller, Aleksandar Prokopec, Viktor Klang
 *
 *  @define multipleCallbacks
 *  Multiple callbacks may be registered; there is no guarantee that they will be
 *  executed in a particular order.
 *
 *  @define caughtThrowables
 *  The future may contain a throwable object and this means that the future failed.
 *  Futures obtained through combinators have the same exception as the future they were obtained from.
 *  The following throwable objects are not contained in the future:
 *  - `Error` - errors are not contained within futures
 *  - `InterruptedException` - not contained within futures
 *  - all `scala.util.control.ControlThrowable` except `NonLocalReturnControl` - not contained within futures
 *
 *  Instead, the future is completed with a ExecutionException with one of the exceptions above
 *  as the cause.
 *  If a future is failed with a `scala.runtime.NonLocalReturnControl`,
 *  it is completed with a value from that throwable instead.
 *
 *  @define nonDeterministic
 *  Note: using this method yields nondeterministic dataflow programs.
 *
 *  @define forComprehensionExamples
 *  Example:
 *
 *  {{{
 *  val f = future { 5 }
 *  val g = future { 3 }
 *  val h = for {
 *    x: Int <- f // returns Future(5)
 *    y: Int <- g // returns Future(3)
 *  } yield x + y
 *  }}}
 *
 *  is translated to:
 *
 *  {{{
 *  f flatMap { (x: Int) => g map { (y: Int) => x + y } }
 *  }}}
 *
 * @define callbackInContext
 * The provided callback always runs in the provided implicit
 *`ExecutionContext`, though there is no guarantee that the
 * `execute()` method on the `ExecutionContext` will be called once
 * per callback or that `execute()` will be called in the current
 * thread. That is, the implementation may run multiple callbacks
 * in a batch within a single `execute()` and it may run
 * `execute()` either immediately or asynchronously.
