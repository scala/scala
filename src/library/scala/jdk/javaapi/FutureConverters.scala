/** This object contains methods that convert between Scala [[scala.concurrent.Future]] and Java [[java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage]].
  *
  * The explicit conversion methods defined here are intended to be used in Java code. For Scala
  * code, it is recommended to use the extension methods defined in [[scala.jdk.FutureConverters]].
  *
  * Note that the bridge is implemented at the read-only side of asynchronous handles, namely
  * [[scala.concurrent.Future]] (instead of [[scala.concurrent.Promise]]) and [[java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage]] (instead of
  * [[java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture]]). This is intentional, as the semantics of bridging
  * the write-handles would be prone to race conditions; if both ends (`CompletableFuture` and
  * `Promise`) are completed independently at the same time, they may contain different values
  * afterwards. For this reason, `toCompletableFuture` is not supported on the created
  * `CompletionStage`s.

    * given Scala [[scala.concurrent.Future]] when that completes. Since the Future is a read-only representation,
    * this CompletionStage does not support the `toCompletableFuture` method.
    *
    * The semantics of Scala Future demand that all callbacks are invoked asynchronously by default,
    * therefore the returned CompletionStage routes all calls to synchronous transformations to
    * their asynchronous counterparts, i.e., `thenRun` will internally call `thenRunAsync`.
