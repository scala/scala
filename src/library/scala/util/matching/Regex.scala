/**
 * This package is concerned with regular expression (regex) matching against strings,

 * them with something else.
 *
 * There are four classes and three objects, with most of them being members of
 * Regex companion object. [[scala.util.matching.Regex]] is the class users instantiate
 * to do regular expression matching.
 *
 * The remaining classes and objects in the package are used in the following way:
 *
 * * The companion object to [[scala.util.matching.Regex]] just contains the other members.
 * * [[scala.util.matching.Regex.Match]] makes more information about a match available.
 * * [[scala.util.matching.Regex.MatchIterator]] is used to iterate over multiple matches.
 * * [[scala.util.matching.Regex.MatchData]] is just a base trait for the above classes.
 * * [[scala.util.matching.Regex.Groups]] extracts group from a [[scala.util.matching.Regex.Match]]
 *   without recomputing the match.
 * * [[scala.util.matching.Regex.Match]] converts a [[scala.util.matching.Regex.Match]]
 *   into a [[java.lang.String]].

/** This class provides methods for creating and using regular expressions.
 *  It is based on the regular expressions of the JDK since 1.4.
 *
 *  Its main goal is to extract strings that match a pattern, or the subgroups
 *  that make it up. For that reason, it is usually used with for comprehensions
 *  and matching (see methods for examples).
 *
 *  A Regex is created from a [[java.lang.String]] representation of the
 *  regular expression pattern^1^. That pattern is compiled
 *  during construction, so frequently used patterns should be declared outside
 *  loops if performance is of concern. Possibly, they might be declared on a
 *  companion object, so that they need only to be initialized once.
 *
 *  The canonical way of creating regex patterns is by using the method `r`, provided
 *  on [[java.lang.String]] through an implicit conversion into
 *  [[scala.collection.immutable.WrappedString]]. Using triple quotes to write these
 *  strings avoids having to quote the backslash character (`\`).
 *
 *  Using the constructor directly, on the other hand, makes
 *  it possible to declare names for subgroups in the pattern.
 *
 *  For example, both declarations below generate the same regex, but the second
 *  one associate names with the subgroups.
 *
 *  {{{
 *  val dateP1 = """(\d\d\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d)""".r
 *  val dateP2 = new scala.util.matching.Regex("""(\d\d\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d)""", "year", "month", "day")
 *  }}}
 *
 *  There are two ways of using a `Regex` to find a pattern: calling methods on
 *  Regex, such as `findFirstIn` or `findAllIn`, or using it as an extractor in a
 *  pattern match.
 *
 *  Note, however, that when Regex is used as an extractor in a pattern match, it
 *  only succeeds if the whole text can be matched. For this reason, one usually
 *  calls a method to find the matching substrings, and then use it as an extractor
 *  to break match into subgroups.
 *
 *  As an example, the above patterns can be used like this:
 *
 *  {{{
 *  val dateP1(year, month, day) = "2011-07-15"
 *
 *  // val dateP1(year, month, day) = "Date 2011-07-15" // throws an exception at runtime
 *
 *  val copyright: String = dateP1 findFirstIn "Date of this document: 2011-07-15" match {
 *    case Some(dateP1(year, month, day)) => "Copyright "+year
 *    case None                           => "No copyright"
 *  }
 *
 *  val copyright: Option[String] = for {
 *    dateP1(year, month, day) <- dateP1 findFirstIn "Last modified 2011-07-15"
 *  } yield year

 *  def getYears(text: String): Iterator[String] = for (dateP1(year, _, _) <- dateP1 findAllIn text) yield year
 *  def getFirstDay(text: String): Option[String] = for (m <- dateP2 findFirstMatchIn text) yield m group "day"
 *  }}}
 *
 *  Regex does not provide a method that returns a [[scala.Boolean]]. One can
 *  use [[java.lang.String]] `matches` method, or, if `Regex` is preferred,
 *  either ignore the return value or test the `Option` for emptyness. For example:
 *
 *  {{{
 *  def hasDate(text: String): Boolean = (dateP1 findFirstIn text).nonEmpty
 *  def printLinesWithDates(lines: Traversable[String]) {
 *    lines foreach { line =>
 *      dateP1 findFirstIn line foreach { _ => println(line) }
 *    }
 *  }
 *  }}}
 *
 *  There are also methods that can be used to replace the patterns
 *  on a text. The substitutions can be simple replacements, or more
 *  complex functions. For example:
 *
 *  {{{
 *  val months = Map( 1 -> "Jan", 2 -> "Feb", 3 -> "Mar",
 *                    4 -> "Apr", 5 -> "May", 6 -> "Jun",
 *                    7 -> "Jul", 8 -> "Aug", 9 -> "Sep",
 *                    10 -> "Oct", 11 -> "Nov", 12 -> "Dec")
 *
 *  import scala.util.matching.Regex.Match
 *  def reformatDate(text: String) = dateP2 replaceAllIn ( text, (m: Match) =>
 *    "%s %s, %s" format (months(m group "month" toInt), m group "day", m group "year")
 *  )
 *  }}}
 *
 *  You can use special pattern syntax constructs like `(?idmsux-idmsux)`ยน to switch
 *  various regex compilation options like `CASE_INSENSITIVE` or `UNICODE_CASE`.

 *  @param pattern    The compiled pattern
 *  @param groupNames A mapping from names to indices in capture groups
 *
 *  @define replacementString
 *  In the replacement String, a dollar sign (`$`) followed by a number will be
 *  interpreted as a reference to a group in the matched pattern, with numbers
 *  1 through 9 corresponding to the first nine groups, and 0 standing for the
 *  whole match. Any other character is an error. The backslash (`\`) character
 *  will be interpreted as an escape character, and can be used to escape the
 *  dollar sign. One can use [[scala.util.matching.Regex]]'s `quoteReplacement`
 *  to automatically escape these characters.
