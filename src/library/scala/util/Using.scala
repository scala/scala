/** A utility for performing automatic resource management. It can be used to perform an
  * operation using resources, after which it releases the resources in reverse order
  * of their creation.
  *
  * ==Usage==
  *
  * There are multiple ways to automatically manage resources with `Using`. If you only need
  * to manage a single resource, the [[Using.apply `apply`]] method is easiest; it wraps the
  * resource opening, operation, and resource releasing in a `Try`.
  *
  * Example:
  * {{{
  * import java.io.{BufferedReader, FileReader}
  * import scala.util.{Try, Using}
  *
  * val lines: Try[Seq[String]] =
  *   Using(new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) { reader =>
  *     Iterator.continually(reader.readLine()).takeWhile(_ != null).toSeq
  *   }
  * }}}
  *
  * If you need to manage multiple resources, [[Using.Manager$.apply `Using.Manager`]] should
  * be used. It allows the managing of arbitrarily many resources, whose creation, use, and
  * release are all wrapped in a `Try`.
  *
  * Example:
  * {{{
  * import java.io.{BufferedReader, FileReader}
  * import scala.util.{Try, Using}
  *
  * val lines: Try[Seq[String]] = Using.Manager { use =>
  *   val r1 = use(new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file1.txt")))
  *   val r2 = use(new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file2.txt")))
  *   val r3 = use(new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file3.txt")))
  *   val r4 = use(new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file4.txt")))
  *
  *   // use your resources here
  *   def lines(reader: BufferedReader): Iterator[String] =
  *     Iterator.continually(reader.readLine()).takeWhile(_ != null)
  *
  *   (lines(r1) ++ lines(r2) ++ lines(r3) ++ lines(r4)).toList
  * }
  * }}}
  *
  * If you wish to avoid wrapping management and operations in a `Try`, you can use
  * [[Using.resource `Using.resource`]], which throws any exceptions that occur.
  *
  * Example:
  * {{{
  * import java.io.{BufferedReader, FileReader}
  * import scala.util.Using
  *
  * val lines: Seq[String] =
  *   Using.resource(new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) { reader =>
  *     Iterator.continually(reader.readLine()).takeWhile(_ != null).toSeq
  *   }
  * }}}
  *
  * ==Suppression Behavior==
  *
  * If two exceptions are thrown (e.g., by an operation and closing a resource),
  * one of them is re-thrown, and the other is
  * [[java.lang.Throwable#addSuppressed added to it as a suppressed exception]].
  * If the two exceptions are of different 'severities' (see below), the one of a higher
  * severity is re-thrown, and the one of a lower severity is added to it as a suppressed
  * exception. If the two exceptions are of the same severity, the one thrown first is
  * re-thrown, and the one thrown second is added to it as a suppressed exception.
  * If an exception is a [[scala.util.control.ControlThrowable `ControlThrowable`]], or
  * if it does not support suppression (see
  * [[java.lang.Throwable `Throwable`'s constructor with an `enableSuppression` parameter]]),
  * an exception that would have been suppressed is instead discarded.
  *
  * Exceptions are ranked from highest to lowest severity as follows:
  *   - `java.lang.VirtualMachineError`
  *   - `java.lang.LinkageError`
  *   - `java.lang.InterruptedException` and `java.lang.ThreadDeath`
  *   - [[scala.util.control.NonFatal fatal exceptions]], excluding `scala.util.control.ControlThrowable`
  *   - `scala.util.control.ControlThrowable`
  *   - all other exceptions
  *
  * When more than two exceptions are thrown, the first two are combined and
  * re-thrown as described above, and each successive exception thrown is combined
  * as it is thrown.
  *
  * @define suppressionBehavior See the main doc for [[Using `Using`]] for full details of
  *                             suppression behavior.

    *
    *

    *       {{{
