/**
 * The `Try` type represents a computation that may either result in an exception, or return a
 * successfully computed value. It's similar to, but semantically different from the [[scala.util.Either]] type.
 *
 * Instances of `Try[T]`, are either an instance of [[scala.util.Success]][T] or [[scala.util.Failure]][T].
 *
 * For example, `Try` can be used to perform division on a user-defined input, without the need to do explicit
 * exception-handling in all of the places that an exception might occur.
 *
 * Example:
 * {{{
 *   import scala.io.StdIn
 *   import scala.util.{Try, Success, Failure}
 *
 *   def divide: Try[Int] = {
 *     val dividend = Try(StdIn.readLine("Enter an Int that you'd like to divide:\n").toInt)
 *     val divisor = Try(StdIn.readLine("Enter an Int that you'd like to divide by:\n").toInt)
 *     val problem = dividend.flatMap(x => divisor.map(y => x/y))
 *     problem match {
 *       case Success(v) =>
 *         println("Result of " + dividend.get + "/"+ divisor.get +" is: " + v)
 *         Success(v)
 *       case Failure(e) =>
 *         println("You must've divided by zero or entered something that's not an Int. Try again!")
 *         println("Info from the exception: " + e.getMessage)
 *         divide
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * }}}
 *
 * An important property of `Try` shown in the above example is its ability to ''pipeline'', or chain, operations,
 * catching exceptions along the way. The `flatMap` and `map` combinators in the above example each essentially
 * pass off either their successfully completed value, wrapped in the `Success` type for it to be further operated
 * upon by the next combinator in the chain, or the exception wrapped in the `Failure` type usually to be simply
 * passed on down the chain. Combinators such as `recover` and `recoverWith` are designed to provide some type of
 * default behavior in the case of failure.
 *
 * ''Note'': only non-fatal exceptions are caught by the combinators on `Try` (see [[scala.util.control.NonFatal]]).
 * Serious system errors, on the other hand, will be thrown.
 *
 * ''Note:'': all Try combinators will catch exceptions and return failure unless otherwise specified in the documentation.
 *
 * `Try` comes to the Scala standard library after years of use as an integral part of Twitter's stack.
 *
 * @author based on Twitter's original implementation in com.twitter.util.
 * @since 2.10
