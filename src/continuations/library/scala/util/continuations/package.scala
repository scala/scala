/**
 * Delimited continuations are a feature for modifying the usual control flow
 * of a program.  To use continuations, provide the option `-P:continuations:enable`
 * to the Scala compiler or REPL to activate the compiler plugin.
 *
 * Below is an example of using continuations to suspend execution while awaiting
 * user input. Similar facilities are used in so-called continuation-based web frameworks.
 *
 * {{{
 *   def go =
 *     reset {
 *       println("Welcome!")
 *       val first = ask("Please give me a number")
 *       val second = ask("Please enter another number")
 *       printf("The sum of your numbers is: %d\n", first + second)
 *     }
 * }}}
 *
 * The `reset` is provided by this package and delimits the extent of the
 * transformation. The `ask` is a function that will be defined below. Its
 * effect is to issue a prompt and then suspend execution awaiting user input.
 * Once the user provides an input value, execution of the suspended block
 * resumes.
 *
 * {{{
 *   val sessions = new HashMap[UUID, Int=>Unit]
 *   def ask(prompt: String): Int @cps[Unit] =
 *     shift {
 *       k: (Int => Unit) => {
 *         val id = uuidGen
 *         printf("%s\nrespond with: submit(0x%x, ...)\n", prompt, id)
 *         sessions += id -> k
 *       }
 *     }
 * }}}
 *
 * The type of `ask` includes a `@cps` annotation which drives the transformation.
 * The type signature `Int @cps[Unit]` means that `ask` should be used in a
 * context requiring an `Int`, but actually it will suspend and return `Unit`.
 *
 * The computation leading up to the first `ask` is executed normally. The
 * remainder of the reset block is wrapped into a closure that is passed as
 * the parameter `k` to the `shift` function, which can then decide whether
 * and how to execute the continuation. In this example, the continuation is
 * stored in a sessions map for later execution. This continuation includes a
 * second call to `ask`, which is treated likewise once the execution resumes.
 *
 * <h2>CPS Annotation</h2>
 *
 * The aforementioned `@cps[A]` annotation is an alias for the more general
 * `@cpsParam[B,C]` where `B=C`. The type `A @cpsParam[B,C]` describes a term
 * which yields a value of type `A` within an evaluation context producing a
 * value of type `B`. After the CPS transformation, this return type is
 * modified to `C`.
 *
 * The `@cpsParam` annotations are introduced by `shift` blocks, and propagate
 * via the return types to the dynamically enclosing context. The propagation
 * stops upon reaching a `reset` block.
 */

   */
  type suspendable = cps[Unit]

  /**
   * The `shift` function captures the remaining computation in a `reset` block
   * and passes it to a closure provided by the user.
   *
   * For example:
   * {{{
   *    reset {
   *       shift { (k: Int => Int) => k(5) } + 1
   *    }
   * }}}
   *
   * In this example, `shift` is used in the expression `shift ... + 1`.
   * The compiler will alter this expression so that the call
   * to `shift` becomes a parameter to a function, creating something like:
   * {{{
   *   { (k: Int => Int) => k(5) } apply { _ + 1 }
   * }}}
   * The result of this expression is 6.
   *
   * There can be more than one `shift` call in a `reset` block.  Each call
   * to `shift` can alter the return type of expression within the reset block,
   * but will not change the return type of the entire `reset { block }`
   * expression.
   *
   * @param fun  A function where
   *   - The parameter is the remainder of computation within the current
   *     `reset` block.  This is passed as a function `A => B`.
   *   - The return is the return value of the `ControlContext` which is
   *     generated from this inversion.
   * @note  Must be invoked in the context of a call to `reset`  This context
   *        may not be far up the stack, but a call to reset is needed to
   *        eventually remove the `@cps` annotations from types.
