/** Provides lightweight, concurrent actors. Actors are created by extending

 *  defined by implementing its `act` method:
 *  {{{
 *  class MyActor extends Actor {
 *    def act() {
 *      // actor behavior goes here
 *    }
 *  }
 *  }}}
 *  A new `Actor` instance is started by invoking its `start` method.
 *
 *  '''Note:''' care must be taken when invoking thread-blocking methods other
 *  than those provided by the `Actor` trait or its companion object (such as
 *  `receive`). Blocking the underlying thread inside an actor may lead to
 *  starvation of other actors. This also applies to actors hogging their
 *  thread for a long time between invoking `receive`/`react`.
 *
 *  If actors use blocking operations (for example, methods for blocking I/O),
 *  there are several options:
 *
 *  - The run-time system can be configured to use a larger thread pool size
 *    (for example, by setting the `actors.corePoolSize` JVM property).
 *  - The `scheduler` method of the `Actor` trait can be overridden to return a
 *    `ResizableThreadPoolScheduler`, which resizes its thread pool to
 *    avoid starvation caused by actors that invoke arbitrary blocking methods.
 *  - The `actors.enableForkJoin` JVM property can be set to `false`, in which
 *    case a `ResizableThreadPoolScheduler` is used by default to execute actors.
 *
 *  The main ideas of the implementation are explained in the two papers
 *
 *  - [[http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~odersky/papers/jmlc06.pdf Event-Based
 *    Programming without Inversion of Control]],
 *    Philipp Haller and Martin Odersky, ''Proc. JMLC 2006'', and
 *  - [[http://lamp.epfl.ch/~phaller/doc/haller07coord.pdf Actors that
 *    Unify Threads and Events]],
