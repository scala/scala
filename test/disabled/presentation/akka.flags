# This file contains command line options that are passed to the presentation compiler
# Lines starting with # are stripped, and you can split arguments on several lines.

# The -bootclasspath option is treated specially by the test framework: if it's not specified
# in this file, the presentation compiler will pick up the scala-library/compiler that's on the
# java classpath used to run this test (usually build/pack)

# Any option can be passed this way, like presentation debug
# -Ypresentation-debug -Ypresentation-verbose

# the classpath is relative to the current working directory. That means it depends where you're
# running partest from. Run it from the root scala checkout for these files to resolve correctly
# (by default when running 'ant test', or 'test/partest'). Paths use Unix separators, the test
# framework translates them to the platform dependent representation.
# -bootclasspath lib/scala-compiler.jar:lib/scala-library.jar

# the following line would test using the quick compiler
# -bootclasspath build/quick/classes/compiler:build/quick/classes/library
