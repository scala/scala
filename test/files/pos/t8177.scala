// because asSeenFrom produced a typeref of the shape T'#A where A referred to a symbol defined in a T of times past
// More precisely, the TypeRef case of TypeMap's mapOver correctly modified prefix
// from having an underlying type of { type A = Ain } to { type A = Int }, with a new symbol for A (now with info Int),
// but the symbol in the outer type ref wasn't co-evolved (so it still referred to the { type A = AIn } underlying the old prefix)
// coEvolveSym used to only look at prefixes that were directly RefinedTypes, but they could also be SingleTypes with an underlying RefinedType
