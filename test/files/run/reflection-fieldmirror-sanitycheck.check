expected a field symbol, you provided a method symbol
A typical cause of this problem is using a field accessor symbol instead of a field symbol.
To obtain a field symbol append nme.LOCAL_SUFFIX_STRING to the name of the field,
when searching for a member with Type.members or Type.declarations.
This is a temporary inconvenience that will be resolved before 2.10.0-final.
