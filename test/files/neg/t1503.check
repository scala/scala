t1503.scala:7: warning: The value matched by Whatever is bound to n, which may be used under the
unsound assumption that it has type Whatever.type, whereas we can only safely
count on it having type Any, as the pattern is matched using `==` (see scala/bug#1503).

t1503.scala:7: warning: match may not be exhaustive.
It would fail on the following input: (x: Any forSome x not in Whatever)
