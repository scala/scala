t1503.scala:7: warning: Typing of identifier patterns will become more conservative (see SI-1503).
Value n (the value matched by Whatever) is wrongly assumed to have type Whatever.type,
whereas we can only safely count on it having type Any, as the pattern is matched using ==.
  def matchWhateverCCE(x: Any) = x match { case n @ Whatever => n }
