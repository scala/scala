reify_metalevel_breach_-1_refers_to_0_a.scala:9: error: the splice cannot be resolved statically, which means there is a cross-stage evaluation involved.
cross-stage evaluations need to be invoked explicitly, so we're showing you this error.
if you're sure this is not an oversight, add scala-compiler.jar to the classpath,
import `scala.tools.reflect.Eval` and call `<your expr>.eval` instead.
  val code = reify{outer.splice.splice}
                                ^
