ordering-migration.scala:3: warning: object DeprecatedFloatOrdering in object Ordering has changed semantics in version 2.13.0:
  The default implicit ordering for floats now maintains consistency
  between its `compare` method and its `lt`, `min`, `equiv`, etc., methods,
  which means nonconforming to IEEE 754's behavior for -0.0F and NaN.
  The sort order of floats remains the same, however, with NaN at the end.
  Import Ordering.Float.IeeeOrdering to recover the previous behavior.
