t4749.scala:6: warning: Fail2 has a main method with parameter type Array[String], but bippy.Fail2 will not be a runnable program.
  Reason: main methods cannot be generic.

t4749.scala:13: warning: Fail3 has a main method with parameter type Array[String], but bippy.Fail3 will not be a runnable program.
  Reason: main methods cannot refer to type parameters or abstract types.

t4749.scala:16: warning: Fail4 has a main method with parameter type Array[String], but bippy.Fail4 will not be a runnable program.
  Reason: companion is a trait, which means no static forwarder can be generated.

t4749.scala:21: warning: Fail5 has a main method with parameter type Array[String], but bippy.Fail5 will not be a runnable program.
  Reason: companion contains its own main method, which means no static forwarder can be generated.

t4749.scala:26: warning: Fail6 has a main method with parameter type Array[String], but bippy.Fail6 will not be a runnable program.
  Reason: companion contains its own main method (implementation restriction: no main is allowed, regardless of signature), which means no static forwarder can be generated.
