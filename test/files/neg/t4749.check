t4749.scala:2: warning: Fail1 has a main method with parameter type Array, but bippy.Fail1 will not be a runnable program.
A runnable program is an object with a method main that has the exact
signature (Array[String])Unit, doesn't have a trait as a companion class,
doesn't have a companion class with a method called main, has no type
paremters, and doesn't inherit or override anything.
This fails because: main method must have exact signature (Array[String])Unit

t4749.scala:6: warning: Fail2 has a main method with parameter type Array, but bippy.Fail2 will not be a runnable program.
A runnable program is an object with a method main that has the exact
signature (Array[String])Unit, doesn't have a trait as a companion class,
doesn't have a companion class with a method called main, has no type
paremters, and doesn't inherit or override anything.
This fails because: main methods cannot be generic.

t4749.scala:13: warning: Fail3 has a main method with parameter type Array, but bippy.Fail3 will not be a runnable program.
A runnable program is an object with a method main that has the exact
signature (Array[String])Unit, doesn't have a trait as a companion class,
doesn't have a companion class with a method called main, has no type
paremters, and doesn't inherit or override anything.
This fails because: main methods cannot refer to type parameters or abstract types.

t4749.scala:16: warning: Fail4 has a main method with parameter type Array, but bippy.Fail4 will not be a runnable program.
A runnable program is an object with a method main that has the exact
signature (Array[String])Unit, doesn't have a trait as a companion class,
doesn't have a companion class with a method called main, has no type
paremters, and doesn't inherit or override anything.
This fails because: companion is a trait, which means no static forwarder can be generated.

t4749.scala:21: warning: Fail5 has a main method with parameter type Array, but bippy.Fail5 will not be a runnable program.
A runnable program is an object with a method main that has the exact
signature (Array[String])Unit, doesn't have a trait as a companion class,
doesn't have a companion class with a method called main, has no type
paremters, and doesn't inherit or override anything.
This fails because: companion contains its own main method, which means no static forwarder can be generated.

t4749.scala:26: warning: Fail6 has a main method with parameter type Array, but bippy.Fail6 will not be a runnable program.
A runnable program is an object with a method main that has the exact
signature (Array[String])Unit, doesn't have a trait as a companion class,
doesn't have a companion class with a method called main, has no type
paremters, and doesn't inherit or override anything.
This fails because: companion contains its own main method (implementation restriction: no main is allowed, regardless of signature), which means no static forwarder can be generated.
