using-source3b.scala:13: error: reference to f is ambiguous;
it is both defined in the enclosing class D and inherited in the enclosing class E as method f (defined in class C)
In Scala 2, symbols inherited from a superclass shadow symbols defined in an outer scope.
Such references are ambiguous in Scala 3. To continue using the inherited symbol, write `this.f`.
Or use `-Wconf:msg=legacy-binding:s` to silence this warning. [quickfixable]
