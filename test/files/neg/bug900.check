bug900.scala:4: error: type mismatch;
 found   : Foo.this.x.type (with underlying type Foo.this.bar)
 required: AnyRef
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method any2Ensuring in object Predef of type [A](x: A)Ensuring[A]
 and method any2ArrowAssoc in object Predef of type [A](x: A)ArrowAssoc[A]
 are possible conversion functions from Foo.this.x.type to AnyRef
