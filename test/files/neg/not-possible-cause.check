Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method any2stringfmt in object Predef of type (x: Any)scala.runtime.StringFormat
 and method any2stringadd in object Predef of type (x: Any)scala.runtime.StringAdd
 are possible conversion functions from a.type to AnyRef
