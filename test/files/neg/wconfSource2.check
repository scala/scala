wconfSource2.scala:7: reflective access of structural type member method f should be enabled
by making the implicit value scala.language.reflectiveCalls visible.
This can be achieved by adding the import clause 'import scala.language.reflectiveCalls'
or by setting the compiler option -language:reflectiveCalls.
See the Scaladoc for value scala.language.reflectiveCalls for a discussion
why the feature should be explicitly enabled.
