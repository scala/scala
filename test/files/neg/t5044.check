t5044.scala:6: warning: type-checking the invocation of method foo checks if the named argument expression 'id = ...' is a valid assignment
in the current scope. The resulting type inference error (see above) can be fixed by providing an explicit type in the local definition for id.
    val a = foo(id = 1)
