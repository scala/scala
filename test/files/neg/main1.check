main1.scala:3: warning: Foo has a main method with parameter type Array, but foo1.Foo will not be a runnable program.
A runnable program is an object with a method main that has the exact
signature (Array[String])Unit, doesn't have a trait as a companion class,
doesn't have a companion class with a method called main, has no type
paremters, and doesn't inherit or override anything.
This fails because: companion is a trait, which means no static forwarder can be generated.

  object Foo {  // companion is trait

A runnable program is an object with a method main that has the exact
signature (Array[String])Unit, doesn't have a trait as a companion class,
doesn't have a companion class with a method called main, has no type
paremters, and doesn't inherit or override anything.
This fails because: companion contains its own main method, which means no static forwarder can be generated.

main1.scala:28: warning: Foo has a main method with parameter type Array, but foo4.Foo will not be a runnable program.
A runnable program is an object with a method main that has the exact
signature (Array[String])Unit, doesn't have a trait as a companion class,
doesn't have a companion class with a method called main, has no type
paremters, and doesn't inherit or override anything.
This fails because: companion contains its own main method (implementation restriction: no main is allowed, regardless of signature), which means no static forwarder can be generated.
