Impls_Macros_Test_1.scala:36: error: macro implementation not found: foo (the most common reason for that is that you cannot use macro implementations in the same compilation run that defines them)
if you do need to define macro implementations along with the rest of your program, consider two-phase compilation with -Xmacro-fallback-classpath in the second phase pointing to the output of the first phase
  println(foo(2) + Macros.bar(2) * new Macros().quux(4))
             ^
one error found
