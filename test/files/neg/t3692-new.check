t3692-new.scala:4: warning: Tester has a main method with parameter type Array, but Tester will not be a runnable program.
A runnable program is an object with a method main that has the exact
signature (Array[String])Unit, doesn't have a trait as a companion class,
doesn't have a companion class with a method called main, has no type
paremters, and doesn't inherit or override anything.
This fails because: main method must have exact signature (Array[String])Unit
