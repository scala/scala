sensitive2.scala:6: error: type mismatch;
 found   : String("abc")
 required: Test.Foo[_]
Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:
 both method foo1 in object Test of type [A](a: A)Test.Foo[A]
 and method foo2 in object Test of type (a: Any)Test.Foo[String]
 are possible conversion functions from String("abc") to Test.Foo[_]
  val a: Foo[_] = "abc"
                  ^
