B.scala:19: error: reference to c is ambiguous;

In Scala 2, symbols inherited from a superclass shadow symbols defined in an outer scope.
Such references are ambiguous in Scala 3. To continue using the inherited symbol, write `this.c`.
Or use `-Wconf:msg=legacy-binding:s` to silence this warning. [quickfixable]
