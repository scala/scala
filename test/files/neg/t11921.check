t11921.scala:6: error: reference to coll is ambiguous;
it is both defined in method lazyMap and available as method coll in trait Iterable
Since 2.13.11, symbols inherited from a superclass no longer shadow symbols defined in an outer scope.
If shadowing was intended, write `this.coll`.
Or use `-Ylegacy-binding` to enable the previous behavior everywhere.
      def iterator = coll.iterator.map(f)    // coll is ambiguous
                     ^
