# Test for class-based invalidation of dependencies
# by inheritance. The source file A.scala defines
# A and A2 classes. The B.scala inherits from A2 but
# in the test api of A is modified. B.scala shouldn't
# get invalidated if invalidation happens at
# class level
# this test case covers https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/2320

# introduces first compile iteration
> compile
> checkRecompilations 0 A A2 B C
$ copy-file changes/A1.scala src/main/scala/A.scala
# second iteration and third iteration (due to invalidation of C)
> compile
> checkRecompilations 1 A A.AA A2
> checkRecompilations 2 C
$ copy-file changes/A2.scala src/main/scala/A.scala
# fourth iteration
> compile
# check if there were exactly four compile iterations performed
> checkRecompilations 0 B
> checkRecompilations 1
> checkRecompilations 2 C
> checkRecompilations 3 A A2 A.AA
