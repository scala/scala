# Tests that classpath entries that are different than their canonical representation are
#  handled properly.  In particular, a symlink from lib/a.jar to lib/../actual/a.jar.0 is 
#  available on the classpath and read by scalac.  scalac 2.10.x does not interpret .jar.0
#  as a jar, so if sbt passes the canonical path, it will not be read.
# This also verifies that compilation does not get repeatedly triggered by a mismatch in
#  paths.
